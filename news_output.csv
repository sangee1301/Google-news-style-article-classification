nytimes,A Desperate Exodus From ISIS’s Final Village,"['Written By', 'Photographs By']","She said that she had been a committed citizen of the caliphate, but that hunger had forced her to surrender. For weeks, she said, she and her daughters subsisted on animal feed. Another woman spoke of scavenging for a plant that grows in the crevices between houses and in traffic circles, which she boiled and forced herself to eat.

The increasing peril that the Islamic State’s own families were subjected to was evident in the number of people who showed up every day with injuries.

One woman, her leg torn by shrapnel, was lifted from an arriving truck and held up as she hopped to the spot where other women were waiting to be screened. An older man collapsed on a mattress, suffering from a back injury. A woman in her 20s made it to the processing point, only to die soon after she arrived. Her family could do little beyond covering her with a blanket.

A schoolgirl from Turkey, the daughter of an Islamic State family, was sitting wrapped in a blanket, unable to stand because of her injuries from a mortar round. And a 6-year-old boy was rushed to a first aid station staffed by a group of recently arrived American aid workers.

“He’s not going to make it. His pulse is too low,” warned one of the paramedics, Jason Torlano of Yosemite, Calif., a member of an aid group called the Free Burma Rangers. The boy began trembling and whimpering in pain, straining from wounds to his head, arm and leg. The medics wrapped him in a heated blanket and tried to find a vein to start an IV drip, the bag of fluid taped to the hood of a Toyota Land Cruiser. “Hey, buddy,” the aid worker said, as the boy began to lose consciousness. “Stay with me.”

His mother stood nearby, repeatedly lifting the black fabric covering her face to wipe her eyes with a piece of Kleenex.

She said that she was from Aleppo and that her husband had been killed in an airstrike, but she denied being part of the Islamic State. Security forces from the Kurdish militia said that they considered her and the majority of the others who have arrived to be the wives and children of Islamic State members: Why else, they said, would a woman and a child who are not natives of the area make their way into an active war zone?",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/middleeast/isis-baghuz.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
nytimes,Workers’ Activism Rises as China’s Economy Slows. Xi Aims to Rein Them In.,[],"As economic forecasts have turned more sober, Mr. Xi has sought to defuse tensions by urging companies to pay salaries for low-income workers on time. The State Council, China’s cabinet, says it wants to eliminate wage arrears by next year.

Labor protests in China are common, and to avoid protracted conflicts, local officials often put pressure on businesses to settle disputes. But companies may be more unwilling — or unable — to do so now as they struggle to find money.

Mr. Xi has expanded the party’s oversight of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the party-controlled organ that is supposed to mediate disputes for its more than 300 million members but often sides with management. He has also dismantled nonprofit labor advocacy groups, which in the past provided advice to workers and helped with collective bargaining.

In a crackdown in Shenzhen in late January, the authorities detained five veteran labor rights advocates and accused them of “disturbing public order,” a vague charge the party often uses against its critics.

Now, with no independent unions, courts or news outlets to turn to, some workers are resorting to extreme measures to settle disputes.

Wang Xiao, 33, a construction worker, grew tired of lobbying his bosses for more than $2,000 in unpaid wages for a project in the eastern province of Shandong. So last week he turned to social media, threatening to jump off the headquarters of the company overseeing the project.

“If I get to the roof of the building and make a scene, then the money will be given to me more quickly,” he said in an interview. (Mr. Wang did not carry out his threat.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/asia/china-workers-protests.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00

But when she read an article on social media on Tuesday saying a woman had accused Óscar Arias Sánchez, the former president of Costa Rica, of sexual assault, she did not hesitate: “From personal experience with him,” she wrote on the social media platform, “I BELIEVE her!!”

Ms. Antillón is among four women in a 48-hour period to accuse Mr. Arias, 78, of unprovoked and unwanted touching or sexual assault.

The allegations are a serious blow to the legacy of Mr. Arias, who won the Nobel Prize in 1987 for his effort to bring peace to Central America. Twice president of Costa Rica, he has been one of Latin America’s most respected figures.

For months, the centuries-old Sabarimala Temple, which sits on a hill in the southern state of Kerala, has been the site of violent protests and riots over whether women of childbearing age could set foot inside.

The drama has captivated India, encapsulating bigger issues of religious extremism, women’s rights and the rule of law.

Even with the religious board’s reversal, the controversy is far from over. The Supreme Court on Wednesday was hearing arguments — once again — about the status of the temple. Last year, the court ruled that women ages 10 to 50 had the right to visit the shrine, but religious groups had pleaded with judges to reconsider their decision.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/asia/women-temple-hindu-india.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
nytimes,Sexual Abuse of Nuns: A Longstanding Church Scandal Emerges From Shadows,[],"Karlijn Demasure, the former executive director of the church’s Center for Child Protection at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where she is a professor and expert in the sexual abuse of minors and vulnerable adults, said there is no data on how widespread the problem is. But, she added, anecdotal evidence suggests “it’s not exceptional.”

Many members of the church, experts said, suffer from a medieval mind-set and consider the priests who commit abuse against nuns to be the victims of seductive temptresses. Since the victims in these cases are adults, the experts say, there is also a reflexive tendency to blame them. The reductive public image of the nun as existing to serve the priest and to pray quietly also undercuts those who speak up.

Often, the abuse occurs in a relationship of spiritual guidance, Professor Demasure said, with the priest grooming the victim over time, as is often the case in cases of child sexual abuse.

The apparent preponderance of such abuse in Africa and India has led some in the church to chalk the abuse up to cultural differences.

In many cases, sexual favors have been required of nuns who are financially dependent on priests, and traditions of subservience by women make them vulnerable to abuse.

Ms. Scaraffia said she subscribed to the pope’s critique of abuse, that it is rooted in a rot in clerical culture that leads priests to believe they are a higher authority, and thus entitled to do what they want with their parishioners. In developing countries, where the abuse of nuns seems more prevalent, priests tend to be put on even higher pedestals.

Professor Demasure said there is also the delicate issue that female superiors have covered up the abuse of their nuns to protect the reputation of the church, just as bishops have done with pedophile priests.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/europe/pope-francis-sexual-abuse-nuns.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
nytimes,Revolt at American University Where Pompeo Addressed Middle East,[],"CAIRO — In a fiery speech at the American University in Cairo last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sided with the autocrats who dominate the Middle East and played down the Arab Spring protests that upended the region in 2011.

This week that speech became the trigger for a revolt against the man who hosted it: Francis J. Ricciardone, the university’s president and a former American diplomat. Mr. Ricciardone faces an open challenge from academics at the university, one of the most prestigious in the Middle East, who are angered in part by his decision to give Mr. Pompeo an unchallenged platform.

On Tuesday, the university Senate voted overwhelmingly to declare no confidence in Mr. Ricciardone, a former United States ambassador to Egypt, Turkey and the Philippines and Palau. In a resolution, the academics said that they had lost faith in Mr. Ricciardone’s stewardship of the university and urged its New York-based board of trustees to immediately begin the search for a successor.

The academics said their grievances against Mr. Ricciardone, who has been the university’s leader since 2016, long predated Mr. Pompeo’s speech on Jan. 10. In a letter to Mr. Ricciardone, faculty members cited low morale, complaints about his management style, grievances over contracts and accusations of illegal discrimination.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/middleeast/american-university-cairo-pompeo.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00

Mr. Fraser predicted “another week or two of wheel-spinning, rather than forward propulsion.”

Mrs. May is expected to say that she wants urgently to work with the European Union to secure changes to a plan for Brexit — one that suffered a crushing 230-vote defeat in Britain’s 650-seat Parliament, leaving the whole process in limbo.

But that will require changes in the Irish backstop, designed to avoid customs checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Irish backstop plan is loathed by the hard-line supporters of Brexit whom Mr. Tusk excoriated, because it could keep the United Kingdom tied, indefinitely, to some European Union rules.

So Conservative lawmakers from different sides of the debate have spent three days negotiating a plan in London that they hope Mrs. May will press.

This so-called Malthouse Compromise could effectively mean Britain paying into the European Union until 2021 in order to smooth its exit, allowing it to negotiate a trade plan that would prevent the need for border checks in Ireland — or to prepare better for a no-deal exit.

So far European officials have shown no interest in that idea, or in others raised by Mrs. May, such as a time limit for the backstop or a unilateral exit mechanism. Both those concepts would invalidate the purpose of the backstop, they say.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/europe/theresa-may-brexit-tusk-brussels-backstop.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00

Stephen Biegun, the Trump administration’s special representative for North Korea, arrived in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, around the time that Mr. Trump announced in his State of the Union address that he and Mr. Kim would meet for a second time on Feb. 27-28 in Vietnam. Mr. Beigun’s trip had been announced in advance.

When Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump first met in Singapore in June, they agreed to work toward the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and to build “new” relations between their countries. But since then, talks have stalled over how to carry out that vaguely worded agreement.

Mr. Trump now wants “significant and verifiable progress on denuclearization, actions that are bold and real,” Mr. Biegun said last week in a speech at Stanford University.

But it plugs another gap in what was once the former Soviet Union’s backyard, and comes at a time when East-West tensions are rising.

North Macedonia’s inclusion also means NATO will soon have 30 members, all committed to their collective defense. That is double what NATO’s membership was in 1991, when many experts thought the alliance would disband with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.

On Wednesday, in a ceremony at NATO’s Brussels headquarters, member countries formally signed a letter of accession for North Macedonia, which should become a full member by year’s end.

Mr. Tsipras’s trip to the hilltop Halki theological seminary near Istanbul, long a fount of Christian scholarship in a mostly Muslim country, raised hopes within the tiny Greek community in Turkey and the wider Orthodox family that the Turkish government might heed calls to allow it to reopen.

The visit to the seminary, on Heybeliada Island in the Sea of Marmara, capped a two-day trip to Turkey by Mr. Tsipras, who met on Tuesday with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara. Though the two leaders have developed a détente, relations between their nations have long been defined by antagonism, and they did not announce progress on any of the many disputes between them.

A brief police account of the attack on Tuesday in semirural Huining County, Gansu Province, left many questions unanswered, including the identities of the victims. But the local public security bureau said that the attacker, a 49-year-old man surnamed Guo, had been drinking and suspected his wife of having an affair.

“According to Guo’s initial confession, he suspected his wife of engaging in illicit sexual relations,” the police report said. It did not give his full name, occupation or other details. “Hatred festered in his heart and he deliberately sought revenge.”

Mr. Guo had been drinking, the account said, and early Tuesday morning he entered another villager’s home with a knife or cleaver and began attacking. The account did not make clear whether he went to more than one home or whether those killed included his wife or other relatives.

Security camera footage showed the building falling into a cloud of dust, as pedestrians fled in panic. Several cars were destroyed.

The Istanbul prosecutor’s office has started an investigation into the cause of the collapse. Turkey has a history of low-quality construction, a factor that was blamed for the high death toll in the 1999 earthquake that struck near Izmit, about 55 miles southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed in the magnitude 7.4 earthquake, and tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed. In the aftermath, the government has pushed to modernize aging urban dwellings.



Mr. Yerlikaya said the building that collapsed on Wednesday had a permit for five stories when it was built in 1992, and that the top three floors were illegal. He said there was also an unlicensed textile workshop on the ground floor.



A natural gas explosion and aging infrastructure were blamed for a building collapse last month in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk that killed 39 people.

So emotional, apparently, that facts and figures count for little.

Germany is woefully behind on meeting its 2020 climate goals, so the government appointed a group of experts to find ways to lower emissions in the transport sector. Cars account for 11 percent of total emissions, and their share is rising.

A highway speed limit of 120 kilometers an hour, or 75 miles per hour, could cover a fifth of the gap to reach the 2020 goals for the transport sector, environmental experts say.

“Of all the individual measures, it is the one that would be the most impactful — and it costs nothing,” said Dorothee Saar, of Deutsche Umwelthilfe, a nonprofit environmental organization that has lobbied for a speed limit.

“But when it comes to cars,” Ms. Saar sighed, “the debate tends to become irrational.”

There are already speed limits on almost 30 percent of roughly 8,000 miles of autobahn, imposed to regulate noise near urban centers and reduce safety risks on roads deemed unfit for unlimited speeding. The number of deadly accidents on stretches of autobahn that have a speed limit is 26 percent lower than on those without.

In 2017, 409 people died on the autobahn and in almost half the cases, the reason was inappropriate speeding, according to the German statistics office.

But that hasn’t swayed public opinion.

About half of Germans remain opposed to autobahn speed limits, a proportion that has not budged in the last decade, according to Michael Kunert, the director of the polling company Infratest Dimap.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/world/europe/germany-autobahn-speed-limit.html,2019-02-03 00:00:00

It doesn’t matter whether Ecuador can afford them.

China gets paid either way.

To settle the bill, China gets to keep 80 percent of Ecuador’s most valuable export — oil — because many of the contracts are repaid in petroleum, not dollars. In fact, China gets the oil at a discount, then sells it for an additional profit.

Pumping enough oil to repay China has become such an imperative for Ecuador that it is drilling deeper in the Amazon, threatening more deforestation.

Ye Jianming’s early efforts to break into the Washington power broker scene didn’t always pan out.

Five years ago, CEFC approached Bobby Ray Inman, a retired admiral and national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, about setting up a joint venture, Mr. Inman said in an interview. The company promised it would pay him $1 million a year, without specifying what business they would go into. He turned down the offer.

Later, Mr. Inman said, CEFC officials called him and said they were considering acquiring oil fields in Syria. Could he help them persuade the American military not to bomb them? Again, he said no.

“They were looking to do business deals in the energy space and they were looking for connections to help them do that,” said Mr. Inman, who said he kept American officials apprised of his communications with CEFC.

Eventually, Mr. Ye met more people. On a 2015 trip to the United States he met with Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, to discuss the economy, according to CEFC.

He also met with Edward W. Scott Jr., a former software tycoon active in Washington political and philanthropic circles, during a dinner at Marcel’s, an upscale Belgian restaurant, ostensibly to talk about CEFC’s interest in buying an ethanol plant in which Mr. Scott had a financial interest. But the conversation instead focused on introductions Mr. Scott might make to other powerful figures he was friendly with, like the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Alexander Pyntikov, a technology entrepreneur who attended the dinner, said several CEFC associates and what appeared to be a dozen bodyguards roamed the restaurant while they talked.

“The whole thing he was into wasn’t very clear,” Mr. Scott said. “It was very murky.”

To build influence, Mr. Ye turned to Vuk Jeremic, a Serbian diplomat and former president of the United Nations General Assembly whom CEFC hired as a consultant, and Mr. Ho, a former Hong Kong official.

nytimes,China’s Tactic to Catch a Fugitive Official: Hold His Two American Children,[],"This account of the Liu family’s plight is based on interviews with administration and congressional officials, university employees and family associates, as well as correspondence by the children to them and public records. There are currently a handful of exit-ban cases involving Americans, but this is the first one in which those with knowledge of it are making the details public.

It is also a rare instance in which one of those being held — Mr. Liu, 19 — was born in the United States. More often, China imposes exit bans, which can last from days to years, on naturalized foreign citizens who were born in China. Security officers often treat them as if they were still Chinese citizens, even though China does not recognize dual nationality.

The law in China states that its nationals automatically lose their citizenship when they gain citizenship in another country. It also says that someone like Mr. Liu who is born with citizenship from another nation is not a Chinese citizen, no matter the parents’ citizenship.

The Liu family members all entered China on American passports, and the State Department is providing them with citizen services. The police from Guangzhou, the southern provincial capital where the father worked, have taken Ms. Han, 51, to a hotel several times to meet with an American consular officer.

Liu Changming, 53, the father, is among China’s most-wanted fugitives, accused of helping to carry out one of the country’s biggest bank frauds, in which $1.4 billion in illegal loans was issued to property developers. He fled the country in 2007.

In recent years, as the Chinese authorities have waged a fierce crackdown on corruption, they have increasingly viewed family members of corrupt officials as being tied to the illegal acts, with the police sometimes aiming to prosecute spouses.

The Liu family has lived with notable wealth in the United States, in part by acquiring real estate, though there is no indication from public records that the properties were purchased with the money that the father is accused of embezzling.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/us/politics/china-exit-ban.html,2018-11-25 00:00:00

Perceptions of power — and Chinese reactions to these projections — have led some analysts to criticize President Barack Obama as having been too timid in countering China over what Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the former head of the United States Pacific Command, memorably called a “great wall of sand” in the South China Sea.

Critics, for instance, have faulted the previous administration for not conducting more frequent freedom of navigation patrols.

“China’s militarization of the South China Sea has been a gradual process, with several phases where alternative actions by the U.S., as well as other countries, could have changed the course of history,” said Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu.

Chief among these moments, Mr. Vuving said, was China’s takeover of Scarborough Shoal. The United States declined to back up the Philippines, a defense treaty ally, by sending Coast Guard vessels or warships to an area that international law has designated as within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.

“Seeing U.S. commitment to its ally, Beijing might not have been as confident as it was with its island-building program,” Mr. Vuving said. “The U.S. failure to support its ally in the Scarborough standoff also demonstrated to people like Duterte that he had no other option than to kowtow to China.”

With most of the Spratly military bases nearing completion by the end of the year, according to Pentagon assessments, the next question is whether — or more likely when — China will begin building on Scarborough.

Mr. Trump, speaking to international diplomats at the State Department, said he expected to soon announce that the United States and its partners, including Syrian Arab and Kurdish allies, will have reclaimed the last slivers of territory that Islamic State fighters control in Syria.

But the president acknowledged that even after that happens, militants will go underground and continue to pose a serious threat wherever the extremist group operates.

“Remnants can be very dangerous,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re sick. They’re demented.”

His comments, echoing themes from his State of the Union address on Tuesday, was a notable departure from the bluster of his assertion in December that the Islamic State had been defeated.

The charges against Mr. da Silva so far have been relatively small chapters in the annals of Lava Jato. He was found guilty in 2017 of accepting a seaside apartment in return for contracts awarded to the construction company O.A.S. and was eventually sentenced to 12 years and one month in prison.

In the new ruling on Wednesday, Judge Gabriela Hardt found Mr. da Silva guilty of accepting bribes from construction companies in the form of a $235,000 renovation of a country house and sentenced him to 12 years and 11 months in prison. Mr. da Silva said his name was not on the title of the home, but prosecutors presented evidence that he and his family had occupied it.

Ten other people were convicted, including top executives at the construction companies.

In the sentencing document, Judge Hardt concluded that it was “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the renovations were funded illicitly by the construction companies Odebrecht and O.A.S.

Ms. Evans said she knew what she was doing was against the law, but she said she had expected a charge of aggravated trespassing, which has been used in previous cases.

Mr. Herring released a statement saying that he dressed like the rapper Kurtis Blow, an acknowledgment that instantly deepened a crisis in the state’s Democratic Party. The governor, Ralph Northam, under siege over a racist photo in his medical school yearbook, admitted last week that he once blackened his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume. Just two days later, Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax, the other one of Virginia’s three statewide officials, faced an allegation of sexual assault, which he denied.

“Because of our ignorance and glib attitudes — and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others — we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup,” Mr. Herring said in a statement on Wednesday.

Alluding to the image from Mr. Northam’s yearbook that has engulfed the governor in turmoil, Mr. Herring added: “That I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt.” He said he was “deeply, deeply sorry” but did not indicate if he would remain in office.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/politics/virginia-blackface-mark-herring.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00

In her statement, Dr. Tyson recounted that she met Mr. Fairfax in July 2004 when they were both working at the convention. They soon realized they had a mutual friend, and on the third day of the convention Mr. Fairfax suggested she get “some fresh air” by accompanying him on a quick errand to retrieve documents from his room in a nearby hotel.

Their previous interactions had not been flirtatious, she said, and so she agreed. Once in the room, he kissed her, she wrote, and “though surprised by his advance, it was not unwelcome and I kissed him back.” He then pulled her toward the bed, where the assault occurred, she wrote.

By the time she met Mr. Fairfax, Dr. Tyson wrote, she had been regularly volunteering at a rape crisis center; on her LinkedIn profile it says she is a founding member of the Survivor Speakers Bureau at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center. She said she felt the incident with Mr. Fairfax “especially degrading” given her volunteer work.

“I did not speak about it for years, and I (like most survivors) suppressed those memories and emotions as a necessary means to continue my studies, and to pursue my goal of building a successful career as an academic,” she wrote.

Some white students said that nothing seemed out of the ordinary when their white classmates wore blackface. It was typical at costume parties or at talent shows, said Dr. William Elwood, a retired family physician who is white and who graduated in 1984, the same year as Mr. Northam.

Dr. Elwood worked on the yearbook that year, laying out pages, he said. For their personal pages, students would submit their own photos to the staff, he said.

Inflation is at astronomical rates, and ordinary people are struggling to get basic food and health supplies. Three million citizens have fled. Some of the collapse can be traced to Mr. Maduro’s economic policies, which do fall under the broad label of socialism. But analysts say that corruption, the lack of rule of law and the absence of democracy — all the hallmarks of a dictatorship — have played just as big or larger roles.

Instead, it will allow for an abortion after 24 weeks to protect the mother’s health or if the fetus is not viable.

nytimes,It’s Official: 2018 Was the Fourth Warmest Year on Record,"['John Schwartz', 'Nadja Popovich']","Source: NASA | By The New York Times

NASA scientists announced Wednesday that the Earth’s average surface temperature in 2018 was the fourth highest in nearly 140 years of record-keeping and a continuation of an unmistakable warming trend.

The data means that the five warmest years in recorded history have been the last five, and that 18 of the 19 warmest years ever recorded have occurred since 2001. The quickly rising temperatures over the past two decades cap a much longer warming trend documented by researchers and correspond with the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by human activity.

“We’re no longer talking about a situation where global warming is something in the future,” said Gavin A. Schmidt, director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the NASA group that conducted the analysis. “It’s here. It’s now.”

While this planet has seen hotter days in prehistoric times, and colder ones in the modern era, what sets recent warming apart in the sweep of geologic time is the relative suddenness of the rise in temperatures and its clear correlation with increasing levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane produced by human activity over the same period.

The results of this rapid warming can be seen from the heat waves in Australia and extended droughts to coastal flooding in the United States, in disappearing Arctic ice and shrinking glaciers. Scientists have linked climate change to more destructive hurricanes like Michael and Florence last year, and have found links to such phenomena as the polar vortex, which last week delivered bone-chilling blasts to the American Midwest and Northeast.

The Earth’s temperature in 2018 was more than one degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, above the average temperature of the late 19th century, when humans started pumping large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Scientists say that if the world is to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, global temperatures must not rise by more than two degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels.

Even an increase of 1.5 degrees will have dire consequences, according to the United Nations science panel on climate change.

Dr. Schmidt spoke of these lines not as cliffs that the world would plunge over, however, but part of a continuing slide toward increasing levels of harm. “Symbolically, it’s important,” he said.

With concerted effort to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide, scientists say, a slide could be slowed or even, eventually, reversed.

The warmest year was 2016, its record-setting temperature amplified by the Pacific Ocean phenomenon known as El Niño. In 2018, the world experienced the opposite phenomenon, a cooling La Niña, with a weak El Niño toward the end of the year.

The effects of the El Niño late last year are likely to be felt in 2019, said Zeke Hausfather, an analyst with Berkeley Earth, an independent climate research group. He said that 2019 would probably be the second-warmest year on record. Last month, Mr. Hausfather issued figures correctly ranking 2018 as the fourth-warmest.

The publication of the NASA temperature data came in tandem with a similar announcement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which uses a slightly different methodology to determine overall changes in the planet’s temperature but also ranked 2018 as the fourth-warmest year.

The two federal agencies, while broadly consistent, have disagreed on the relative rankings for some years; NASA called 2017 the second-warmest year, while NOAA said it was the third, after 2016 and 2015.

In related research, two new studies published Wednesday in the journal Nature suggested that melting polar ice caps could lead to even more extreme weather.

One study, led by Tamsin L. Edwards, a climate scientist at King’s College London, focused on the impact of Antarctic ice-shelf collapse. It estimated that sea level rise caused by melting in Antarctica would be close to ten inches, much lower than a 2016 study based on much of the same data, that forecast a rise of five or six feet by 2100.

But even this lower estimate for sea level rise would be enough to trigger an increase in extreme weather events, according to a companion study led by Nicholas Golledge, an associate professor at the Victoria University of Wellington’s Antarctic Research Centre in New Zealand.

For example, Dr. Golledge said, an influx of fresh water from Greenland could slow the circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, which, among other things, would lead to warmer waters in the Gulf of Mexico and, subsequently, more hurricanes.

In addition to the fourth warmest year on record, 2018 was also the fourth-costliest for weather disasters in the United States. Last year’s total was $91 billion, less than 2017, when disasters inflicted a record breaking $306 billion dollars of damage. But it reflects a broader trend of more frequent and intense extreme weather events including hurricanes, floods, droughts and wildfires that scientists say are to be expected with a warming climate. According to NOAA, 2018 was the first time on record when wildfires have exceeded average hurricane costs in the United States.

Dr. Schmidt of NASA said that the new global temperature figures helped to validate the scientific models that have predicted such warming over time.

“People say, ‘How do we know the science is any good? How do we trust the models? They’re so complex!’ ” But, he said: “That’s the essence of science. You think you understand how something works, you make models and you make predictions and see if they come true. Unfortunately, we’re in a situation where we see it’s come true.”",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/06/climate/fourth-hottest-year.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00

President Trump didn’t mention climate change in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, but on Wednesday Democrats worked to make sure the topic was front and center in Congress.

In two separate and simultaneous House committee hearings on global warming, lawmakers testified that climate change is real, happening now and requires urgent action. It was the first hearing the Energy and Commerce Committee had held on global warming in six years; for the Natural Resources Committee it was the first in more than eight years. In both cases, the rooms were packed with spectators.

“It’s a breath of fresh air,” said Representative Joe Neguse, Democrat of Colorado, who called climate change “the defining issue of our time.”

Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, and Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, urged Congress to rein in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change, they said, has already hurt apple growers, farmers and military installations in North Carolina and commercial fisheries, maple syrup producers and ski resorts in the Northeast.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/climate/congress-climate-hearings.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
nytimes,Beto O’Rourke Was Once Adrift in New York City. Now He’s Searching Again.,[],"All at once, New York City seemed to be conspiring against Beto O’Rourke.

His girlfriend was moving to France. His punk bandmates had scattered. Twenty-three and searching — with an Ivy League degree that could not pay rent — Mr. O’Rourke subsisted as a live-in nanny on the Upper West Side, with a futon in the maid’s quarters, watching over a wealthy family’s two preschoolers.

“I just remember his dad coming,” said the former girlfriend, Sasha Watson, recalling a pep talk from Pat O’Rourke, a prominent Texas county commissioner and judge, who insisted his son was destined for “bigger things.”

“He really saw great things for Beto.”

Great things were not happening. By late 1995, Mr. O’Rourke had fallen into the deepest depression he can remember. He worked for an uncle’s tech business because it was a job. He spent nights alone listening to his cassettes because it passed the time.

“Little bit of a sad case,” Mr. O’Rourke said.

More than two decades later, long after what friends describe as a quarter-life crisis, Mr. O’Rourke has arrived at a midlife crossroads of enormous consequence, with revealing parallels to his time in New York. Forty-six and searching — after a narrow Senate loss in Texas last year that propelled the former El Paso congressman to Democratic stardom — he has been driving around the country, alone, introducing himself to strangers, deciding if he wants to run for president.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/politics/beto-orourke-president.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
nytimes,Beto O’Rourke On the Road: An Annotated Travel Log,[],"Everyone I met was proud. Really into what they were doing. The instructors, the staff, the students. Dylan came across as a born leader — confident, humble, thoughtful and full of purpose. Outside as we concluded the tour of the campus I looked up and imagined the courage it takes to climb out onto the face of these giant turbines, 250 feet up in the air. I said goodbye to Dylan, Jose, Brandon and the others.

As politicians go, Mr. O’Rourke is hardly unique in name-checking the locals he encounters. But he is among the more prolific. His town hall events last year frequently began with a lengthy recitation of people he met, where he’d met them and what he ate in the towns where he met them.

I drove to 1710 Second Street. It’s now a First National Bank parking lot. Went to the Tucumcari library to see if I could find anything about James and Anna and what was going on in 1910. I didn’t, but saw a book the community had put together honoring those who were killed in World War II. At the reading table a group of older men were gathered, talking politics, in Spanish and in English. Seemed to be a regular get together. Those jokers in Washington D.C. Why didn’t Hillary do this? Or that? And Trump!

Mr. O’Rourke’s uncle remembered him once musing about how nice it would be to run a kind of gathering spot for political dialogue. “I want to have that burrito store,” the uncle, Brooks Williams, recalled Mr. O’Rourke saying once. “I want to have that place downtown where politicians come in and talk.”

Drove out to the lake the waitress had told me about. Had it all to myself and some ducks. Found some crab claws. Maybe left by a bird. Walked out on a pier. Looked out, took some pictures. Leaned over, scooped up water and washed my face. Picked up beer cans that someone had left and were blown into the bushes. Later learned that it’s called Ute Lake. Formed by damming the Canadian River. Drove to Dalhart. Ate at the Grill. Was last there in August of 2017. Green chile cheeseburger. The table over asked if I was Beto. We talked about the campaign, about Dalhart. Talked about the livestock show they were on their way to. Dropped in at the VA clinic to say hello to the team there. I had visited in 2017 and they’d really made an impression on me. A staff of two and a visiting doctor take care of veterans from a huge area — including parts of Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas and New Mexico. They seemed well and I got back in the truck, drove on, thinking about this story I’d read the night before about a veteran who comes back home by George Saunders. I read it twice, because it was so good and also because I wasn’t totally sure that I understood what happened at the end of it. Had so many thoughts and questions about it. Not completely spelled out, not neatly defined and tied up. Wanted to talk to someone about it and maybe understand it better from their perspective. I called Kate. She saw the ending differently than I did. More of an epiphany, less of a catastrophe. We were cut off by bad service and finished the conversation by text later in the day.

In a recent interview, Mr. O’Rourke, an English major at Columbia University, detailed some pieces of literature that had made him think through the years: Greek tragedies (“the Greeks got me, man”), a Proust work (“man, it was powerful”) and the autobiography of Woody Guthrie.

I got to Goodwell and right away saw the sign for Oklahoma Panhandle State University on my left. Turned in and met Teri who was waiting for me. I had decided that morning that I’d stop in Goodwell and we’d reached out to see if anyone would like to meet. She showed me to a lecture hall where there were about 40–50 students and faculty. We talked about everything and anything that anyone wanted to talk about. First question: Why in the world was I in Goodwell? It’s on 54, and that’s the road I started on in El Paso. Never been to Goodwell and wanted to see what was here and who lived here and what they were thinking. We talked about healthcare. About war and veterans. We talked about the border and immigration and Dreamers. We talked about corporate influence in politics, PACs and election finance. We talked about how hard it is to afford college. A recruiter for OPSU told me about the anxiety she encounters among kids in high school who don’t think they’ll ever have the money to come here. Listened to a young woman who is studying to be a teacher, wants to teach kindergarten. Asked me how we improve the chances for children of color who are suspended and expelled at up to five times the rate of white children as early as kindergarten. Someone else asked about the criminal justice system and the disproportionate number of black men and women behind bars.

Critics of Mr. O’Rourke have at times rolled their eyes at his tendency to identify problems without always proposing firm solutions. This was rarely an issue in his Senate race, when Democrats were so united against his Republican opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, but could be a problem in a presidential primary.

We talked about bringing the country together. Talked about national service, more young people finding purpose and common cause with their fellow Americans helping to rebuild the country — serving in whatever capacity helps to make this country stronger — infrastructure and public works, blazing and keeping trails into the wild, serving veterans and supporting teachers in the classroom. Being together, working together, for this country. A young woman asked, how do I make a difference in any of this? I said run for office. Hold town hall meetings. Bring people together, over coffee, over beer, ask your elected reps to show up and be part of the conversation. If they don’t, organize to get their attention. But whatever we do, let’s do it together. Listen to each other, be respectful, decent, kind. Invite those who don’t agree with you and try to see it their way for a minute. Make this democracy work by being as engaged as you possibly can. Otherwise we’ll lose it.

Here is the core of Mr. O’Rourke’s appeal to supporters: His common-cause pitch is a temperamental (and generational) contrast to President Trump.

The meeting broke up, and I had a chance to talk to some of the people who stayed after. The gentleman who’d asked me about corporate money in politics introduced me to his wife. She was wearing a rainbow-colored wig. She explained her kids pick out the wig she’ll wear each day. She’s fighting cancer right now. She wanted to tell me about how fortunate she feels to be able to get the care that she needs. Because she has friends without insurance who go without, completely. And friends who have insurance but are fighting the insurance company at the same time they are fighting their cancer. Missing treatments as they fight for the care they’d been paying for in their premiums. I was moved that she’d tell me about her life, about how she feels about what’s happening to others. I could tell it wasn’t easy, maybe there was some hesitation in being so open. But I was glad that I could stay as long as anyone wanted to stay and talk. I left and it was dark. I drove to Liberal. Thought about continuing through to somewhere else but then was hungry and getting tired. Found a small motel, the Southwinds and pulled in. As he was taking care of another customer in front of me, the owner looked up and said “You look like the guy who ran for senate in Texas!” We talked for a while, he told me about his family and then called them in from a living room that was connected to the front office. His son was about to get on a train to go back to college in Kansas City. Come to KC, that’s where it’s at! His cousin was in from Sugar Land. I asked how much a room was and he said it was nothing. I thanked him and drove across the parking lot to park in front of room 29. I took my suitcase in, a clean, comfortable room.

nytimes,A Dying Young Woman Reminds Us How to Live,[],"Before her diagnosis in 2013, Yip-Williams had done more than her share of living. It was, indeed, something of a miracle that she was alive at age 37 when she traveled to a family wedding and ended up in the hospital where she received her cancer diagnosis. Born poor and blind to Chinese parents in postwar Vietnam, she was sentenced to death by her paternal grandmother, who believed that her disability would bring shame to the family and render her an unmarriageable burden. But when her parents brought her to an herbalist and asked him to euthanize her, he refused.

Image

The family would eventually survive a dangerous escape on a sinking boat to Hong Kong, and less than a year later make their way to the United States, where at 4 years old, Yip-Williams had a surgery that granted her some vision, if not enough to drive or read a menu without a magnifying glass.

She would go on to defy her family’s expectations, eventually graduating from Harvard Law School, traveling the world solo and working at a prestigious law firm where she meets Josh, the love of her life. She becomes a mother and, soon after, a cancer patient, and soon after that, because of this unfortunate circumstance, a magnificent writer.

During the five years from her diagnosis to her death, we enter her world in the most intimate way as she cycles through Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s famous stages of grieving: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Describing the ways in which terminally ill patients cope with their own deaths, these stages weren’t meant to delineate a neat sequential progression but rather the various emotional states a dying person might visit, leave and visit again.

Yip-Williams toggles between optimism and despair, between believing she’ll defy the statistics as she had so many times in her life — “odds are not prophecy” — and trying to persuade her husband to confront their harrowing reality. She makes bargains with God, just as she did as a young girl when, in exchange for her poor vision, she asked for a soul mate one day. (“God accepted my deal!”) She posts pictures of contented normalcy on Facebook — of meals cooked, a car purchased — but rages at her husband, healthy people, the universe and, silently, at the moms at a birthday party who ask how she’s doing. “Oh, fine. Just hanging in there,” she replies, while wanting to scream: “I didn’t deserve this! My children didn’t deserve this!” She frets about the “Slutty Second Wife” her husband will one day marry and the pain her daughters will experience in her absence. And, near the end, she oscillates between being game to try every possible treatment and accepting that nothing will keep her alive.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/books/review/julie-yip-williams-unwinding-miracle.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00

cnn,Top US general says Trump did not consult him on Syria announcement,['Ryan Browne'],"Washington (CNN) The commander of US Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, said Tuesday he ""was not consulted"" prior to President Donald Trump's December announcement that the US would withdraw its troops from Syria.

And despite Trump's claims that ISIS has been defeated, Gen. Joseph Votel said the fight against the terror group is ""not over"" and warned ISIS could regroup after US troops leave.

""I was not aware of the specific announcement. Certainly we are aware that he had expressed a desire and intent in the past to depart Iraq, depart Syria,"" Votel said during a Tuesday hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""So you weren't consulted before that decision was announced?"" Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, asked.

""We were not, I was not consulted,"" Votel responded.

In December, Trump tweeted, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" later releasing a video where he said US troops are ""all coming back, and they're coming back now.""

That decision prompted the resignations of Secretary of Defense James Mattis and the Special Presidential Envoy to the Counter-ISIS campaign Brett McGurk.

Fight against ISIS 'is not over'

""The fight against ISIS and violent extremists is not over, and our mission has not changed,"" Votel said.

He said ISIS still controls about 20 square miles of territory in Syria where the terror group still commands approximately 1,000 to 1,500 fighters.

Votel would not commit to a timeline for the withdrawal. ""I am not under pressure to be out by a specific date,"" he said.

""The fact the President made a decision and we are going to execute his orders here to withdraw forces from Syria and as we do that we're going to do that in a very deliberate manner,"" Votel added.

The Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by US air and artillery strikes, are seeking to drive ISIS from this last area of territory but their advance has been slowed as they have encountered refugees fleeing the area.

A Defense Department Inspector General report published Monday said that ""absent sustained [counterterrorism] pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to twelve months and regain limited territory.""

""We do have to keep pressure on this network, it is a resilient network. It does have certain components that are still left in it, although they are dispersed and disaggregated they have the capability of coming back together if we don't,"" Votel said.

Asked how the US would maintain such pressure after withdrawing the 2,000-plus troops currently in Syria, Votel said ""that is an aspect of the ongoing planning that we are pursuing right now.""

""I won't speculate publicly here about things we might do but there are certainly different ways we can do this, working with partners, working with our own capabilities to continue to keep pressure on this network which I think is absolutely vital,"" he added.

Votel also said that ""a key task"" that the US was looking at was ""the protection of those who have fought valiantly with us and ensuring that they remain safe as our diplomats and United Nations and others pursue a political solution here in Syria,"" referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

Iraq mission unchanged

Votel said that he has not been given ""additional tasks"" with regard to the US military mission in Iraq.

In an interview that was taped Friday, Trump told CBS News that the US would use a base in Iraq as a means to ""watch"" Iran.

""One of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem,"" Trump said, adding that he wouldn't use the US military outpost to strike Iran, but to ""watch"" it.

Asked by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, if the US mission in Iraq is to defeat ISIS, Votel replied, ""that is exactly my understanding,"" adding that the US is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government.

Iraqi officials have criticized Trump's comments, saying that the US was in Iraq at the invitation of Baghdad and that its military presence should not be used against Iran.

Defended US support for Saudis in Yemen

Votel also defended US support to the Saudi-led coalition battling the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen.

""Certainly it is a very significant humanitarian disaster in Yemen but I do believe departing from our partners there removes the leverage that we have to continue to influence them, which I think we have used in a positive manner and I think it further endangers Americans in the region,"" Votel said.

His comments come amid renewed efforts in both the House and Senate to block US support to the Saudi-led coalition.

While the US military stopped providing aerial refueling to coalition warplanes in November, the US continues limited intelligence sharing aimed at countering Houthi missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Asked about a recent CNN report detailing how US supplied military equipment provided to Saudi Arabia and the UAE was winding up in the hands of local militias in Yemen, Votel said, ""We have not authorized Saudi Arabia or the Emirates to re-transfer any of this equipment to other parties on the ground in Yemen.""

""I think we have to look more closely at the allegations in this particular situation to find out what happened,"" he added.",https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/05/politics/votel-trump-syria-withdrawal/index.html,2019-02-05 00:00:00

The Pope's comments, which came during a press conference aboard the papal plane on a return flight to Rome from the United Arab Emirates, come as the Catholic Church is dealing with sexual abuse scandals on several continents.

""There have been priests and also bishops who have done that,"" the Pope said of sexually abusing nuns. ""And I believe that it may still be being done. It's not a thing that from the moment in which you realize it, it's over. The thing goes forward like this. We've been working on this for a long time.""

Francis said the Vatican has ""suspended some clerics, sent them away for this"" and ""dissolved"" some orders of nuns ""that were very tied up in this, a corruption.""

cnn,They saved migrants from deportation. Then they faced terror-related charges,['Bianca Britton'],"London (CNN) Under cover of darkness, the activists use bolt croppers to cut through the airport's perimeter fence, squeezing through the gap they've created and running across the open tarmac towards their target: a plane, readying for take-off.

In the video provided by the group to CNN, they can be seen dressed in bright pink, unfurling a banner reading ""No one is illegal,"" before securing themselves to one another using pipes and expandable building foam beneath the government-chartered aircraft at Stansted Airport, just outside London.

Their aim: to prevent the plane and its passengers -- 60 people whose immigration status had been ruled illegal, and who were being deported back to Nigeria and Ghana -- from leaving British soil.

It worked, but the protesters, aged 27 to 44, say they had no idea of the trouble they were getting themselves into. Now known as the Stansted 15, they were convicted under charges related to terrorism, and faced potential life sentences.

""Adrenaline was pumping, we were feeling very anxious,"" May MacKeith, one of those on the tarmac on March 28, 2017, told CNN. ""Once we cut through the fence, this amazing sense of clarity, direction and calm took over.""

She remembers thinking that whatever the protesters were going through, ""this is nothing in comparison to what people who are being snatched out of their beds in dawn raids.""

MacKeith pictured in a pink beanie on the tarmac at Stansted Airport.

Airport security personnel were seen on the video arriving within minutes, but the activists remained, lying on their backs, for almost 10 hours as police tried to remove and arrest them. Their actions forced the airport to shut down temporarily.

Speaking in a video posted on Facebook, one of the protesters explained to viewers: ""The cabin crew, the pilots have all gone home for the night, and we've just seen all the coaches which were containing detained people have gone back, so we have successfully shut this flight down.""

Emma Hughes, another of those who took part in the action, recalls: ""At that point, we knew probably that the flight was canceled ... that was a brilliant moment.""

Following the Stansted 15's demonstration, activists say 11 people who had been due to be deported that day were subsequently allowed stay in the UK and appeal their cases; they added at least two have been granted leave to remain. When asked about their status, the Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases.

Detainees' emotional testimonies

MacKeith says the Stansted 15 came together after exhausting other options to stop the deportation flights which leave the UK every month. When their requests to members of parliament and lawyers to intervene failed to prevent them, they resolved to take direct action.

May MacKeith is part of the Stansted 15 who prevented a deportation charter flight from taking off.

On their way to the airport, the activists say they took turns reading aloud the emotional testimonies of those who were due to be on board the plane, which had been collected and published by Detained Voices, an independent human rights group which speaks by phone to people being held in detention centers, pending their removal from the country.

The activists said many of those detained fear persecution if they were returned. Their desperate pleas for help had spurred the group on.

Harmondsworth Detention Center near London's Heathrow Airport, where those ruled to be ""illegal"" immigrants are held prior to being returned to their countries of origin.

In the year leading up to September 2018, the UK government says more than 25,000 people were held in immigration detention centers after entering or attempting to enter the country illegally, overstaying visas, being charged with a criminal conviction, or being refused asylum.

MacKeith, 33, grew up next to one such detention center and spent time as a child visiting those inside. ""People I've spoken to who have been in detention say they feel like it's actually worse than prison, because you have no idea how long you're being held for,"" she says.

'Hostile environment' for immigrants

Under rules introduced by the then Home Secretary (and now Prime Minister) Theresa May, the UK government aims to deter illegal immigration by creating a so-called ""hostile environment"" -- using ID checks by healthcare providers, landlords and employers to make life so difficult that undocumented immigrants will voluntarily leave, or face being removed by the state.

In a statement, a UK Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government deports those ""with no legal right to remain in the UK, including foreign national offenders and failed asylum seekers."" It added: ""We expect people to leave the country voluntarily but, where they do not, the Home Office will seek to enforce their departure.""

Luke de Noronha, an expert in UK deportation at Birkbeck University of London says the situation isn't as black and white as politicians and bureaucrats would like to believe. ""People's lives are much more complicated and their connections to the UK are much richer than the Home Office give them credit for.""

De Noronha says he has met young men in detention who have lived in the UK since they were children. ""On the outside of a detention center they would appear to be a kind of Londoner, or Mancunian ... These are people who have British families, British children, British memories and British accents.""

The UK Home Office told CNN that while there is no fixed term on immigration detentions ""it is a myth that we detain people indefinitely,"" adding ""the law does not allow it.""

In statistics published on its website for the full 2017 calendar year, two-thirds of those detained were held for fewer than 29 days, while the overwhelming majority (95%) were held for less than six months. A small percentage -- 1,160 people, or 4% -- of those held were detained for a longer period.

While de Noronha admits some detainees do have criminal records, he says the UK Government shouldn't use that alone as a cause for deportation. ""Should someone selling weed when they're 19 be enough to justify their deportation, even if they moved here aged two?""

Secretive charter flights

The UK does not publish data on its deportation charter flights, but following a Freedom of Information request in 2018 , the Home Office said 40 planes left the country in 2017, heading for countries including Pakistan, Nigeria, Ghana, Jamaica and Albania. In the same year, more than 4,000 people were issued with deportation notices, but 2,600 returnees were withdrawn from flights following last-minute legal action or for other reasons, the FOI request revealed.

Secretive, and from undisclosed locations, de Noronha calls the charter flights ""insidious"" because no independent witnesses are are present when deportees embark, or on board the planes to observe what goes on.

CNN reached out to Titan Airways, the charter airline whose plane the Stansted 15 blocked from taking off but did not receive a response.

Following their arrest, the Stansted 15 were initially charged with aggravated trespass, but the case against them was later upgraded, and they were eventually found guilty of endangering safety at an aerodrome, under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act -- a law brought in after the Lockerbie bombing.

It carries a potential sentence of life imprisonment.

The Stansted 15 activists were found guilty of endangering safety at an aerodrome.

Judith Reed from the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement when the group were convicted that the activists had ""placed themselves, the flight crew, airport personnel and police at serious risk of injury or even death due to their actions on the airfield.""

Amnesty International described the conviction as a ""crushing blow for human rights"" while the activists' lawyer Raj Chada from Hodge, Jones & Allen told CNN it was an abuse of power and of a charge that should only be used for violent acts of terrorism.

""Never in a million years did they think they would be classified as terrorists by the state and be put on trial for such a charge,"" he said, adding that the convictions would affect their future careers, and limit their ability to travel.

'The only people in danger were the deportees'

Charity worker Hughes gave birth to her son 10 days after the guilty verdict was announced. Prior to the sentencing on Wednesday, she told CNN she feared the prospect of being separated from her baby.

The trial ""was incredibly stressful and at a time when I wanted to be thinking about upcoming motherhood and my baby, instead I was really having to worry about being separated from my child if I'm sent to jail,"" Hughes said.

Emma Hughes risks being separated from her newborn son, should she receive a jail sentence on Wednesday.

She added that the charges against the group ""matches nothing that we did that night ... We didn't endanger anyone, the only people in danger were the people due to be deported on that plane.""

Hughes says she now feels even more connected to those being removed on deportation charter flights. ""It really opened my eyes to how the deportation system is separating families and ripping them apart.""

This week, three of the activists were given suspended jail sentences, while the remaining 12 -- including Hughes -- were handed community orders.

But despite the conviction, and having to juggle community service while caring for a newborn, Hughes says she can't regret stopping the plane.

""We know that there were two victims of trafficking who should have never been on that flight ... These are people who never should have been deported, so I'm still glad we stopped that."" The Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases.

Defendants and supporters gathered outside Chelmsford Crown Court on the first day of the trial in 2018.

MacKeith says she believes the actions of the Stansted 15 have prompted a change in attitudes, with more people arguing against deportations and detention centers -- a fight she feels ""deeply privileged"" to be part of. ""I really hope that leads to some significant and lasting change.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/05/uk/stansted-15-deportation-charter-flights-uk-intl-gbr/index.html,2019-02-05 00:00:00
cnn,"As Trump seeks an exit from Afghanistan, Moscow steps in",['Nathan Hodge'],"Moscow (CNN) The Trump administration may be negotiating an exit from Afghanistan, but Russia is stepping up its game there.

On Tuesday, the President Hotel in central Moscow was the scene of an unusual, high-profile event: the launch of a two-day conference on Afghanistan.

This was no mere talking shop; the meeting brought representatives of the Taliban together with some of Afghanistan's main political players, including several of the country's most powerful regional and ethnic leaders.

The meeting, ostensibly organized by members of the Afghan diaspora in Russia, also carried a quasi-official imprimatur. The President Hotel -- formerly known as the October -- belongs to the presidential administration, and Ghulam Mohammad Jalal, one of the organizers of the conference, said the Russian Foreign Ministry had provided ""technical support"" to the event.

Then there was the guest list, topped by Hamid Karzai, who served as Afghanistan's president from late 2001 until 2014 and still has enormous political stature. It was striking to see him sitting at the table in Moscow with representatives of the Taliban.

cnn,"John Cantlie, British journalist held by ISIS, believed to be alive","['Alex Marquardt', 'Eliza Mackintosh']","London (CNN) John Cantlie, a British journalist who was taken hostage in Syria in 2012 and appeared in a number of ISIS propaganda videos during his time in captivity, is believed to be alive, UK Security Minister Ben Wallace said Tuesday.

Wallace told a briefing in London for international reporters, attended by CNN, that the British government believes Cantlie is still being held by ISIS.

Cantlie, an experienced war photographer, was covering the Syrian conflict when he was abducted alongside American journalist James Foley, who was later beheaded by ISIS.

Asked generally about British hostages around the world, Wallace said the UK does not pay ransom and discourages other countries from doing so.

Wallace named Cantlie as the most public and prominent British hostage, and when asked directly if the belief is Cantlie is still alive, he said yes. Wallace would not elaborate or say whether Cantlie is thought to be in the rapidly-diminishing area still held by ISIS.

cnn,Why Hungary's state-sponsored schoolbooks have teachers worried,['Sheena Mckenzie'],"Budapest, Hungary (CNN) Flick through a Hungarian history book for high school students, and you're left in no doubt about the government's view on migrants.

The section on ""Multiculturalism"" opens with a photo of refugees camped under a Budapest railway station. Flanking the image is a speech given by strongman Prime Minister Viktor Orban on the perils of migration: ""We consider it a value that Hungary is a homogenous country,"" he says.

The state-sanctioned textbooks are part of a government shakeup of Hungary's education system that is causing deep unease among some teachers and publishers.

Critics say the textbooks are just one front in a government crusade to remake the education system -- and the country -- in its Christian, nationalist image. Orban has also scrapped academic programs that don't fit with his conservative values, effectively forcing one of Hungary's leading universities to move its courses abroad.

Education 'straight from the state'

The shake-up comes amid weeks of street protests against Orban's hardline policies, signaling cracks in his grip on the central eastern European nation.

Since Orban's populist Fidesz Party swept into power in 2010, and most recently won a landslide victory again in April last year, it has been at the helm of a ""major educational reform,"" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told CNN when it visited Hungary late last year.

Previously, local municipalities oversaw the country's public schools. But in recent years the state has taken over responsibility -- and that includes supplying textbooks, said Kovacs of the measure to tackle funding ""insufficiencies."" He said that ""finally, after almost 20 years of struggle of how to finance and run the education system, we have taken responsibility."" The government hoped to introduce a new curriculum by fall this year, Kovacs added.

The current history textbook for Year Eight students shows Orban opening a bridge and meeting with the Pope.

School books are created in the state-run Education Research and Development Center (OFI) by various contributing experts, explained Ildiko Repárszky, a history teacher and author of some of the earlier versions.

These days, the books don't bear the name of a single author on the cover. Instead, a board of editors reportedly handles the texts from contributors ""completely freely, as raw material, reshaping them at will,"" said Repárszky.

The reforms come as the country's Central European University -- founded by billionaire philanthropist and well-known Orban foe George Soros -- announced last month it had been ""forced out"" of Hungary by a hostile government and was moving its US-accredited courses to the Austrian capital Vienna.

The internationally renowned university called it a ""dark day"" for Hungary and Europe -- something the government dismissed as ""nothing more than a Soros-style political bluff.""

But some educators in Hungary told CNN that Orban's hardline policies were already having a deep impact on the nation's children, long before they entered university.

'This is just everyday politics'

In his small office in central Budapest, chairman of Hungary's Association of History Teachers, Laszlo Miklosi, opens a history book for 14 and 15-year-olds covered in Post-it notes.

He turns to the page on multiculturalism and points to a speech Orban gave to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in May 2015 that laid out Hungary's position on migrants.

In the speech, the Prime Minister said Hungarians considered it a value that their country was homogenous in terms of its ""culture,"" ""traits"" and ""way of thinking."" ""This is just everyday politics,"" said Miklosi, adding ""It doesn't say anything about the actual reasons for existing problems of migration -- instead it's what the current prime minister thinks about it.""

Orban's defiant relationship with the European Union also plays out in a cartoon showing Germany as a giant sow feeding piglets representing Greece, Spain, Belgium and Portugal. Standing apart from the rest and happily munching its own grass, is the Hungary piglet.

In the same geography book under the chapter on ""Population Decline and Migration,"" another cartoon shows a Hungarian boy and girl with the caption: ""The number of those who think Hungary is the best place to live has significantly increased.""

The illustration includes statistics like ""67% of young people can only imagine their future in this country."" And ""every 4th young person lives in a marriage or a permanent relationship and 68% of those who don't, would like to,"" with no clear source for the findings.

The image ""enlarges the patriotic feelings of young people in Hungary, their contentedness with their country, their willingness to get married and start a family -- while also downplaying their willingness to move abroad,"" said Repárszky, who is also part of the Association of History Teachers, which has around 400 members.

Government spokesman Kovacs dismissed the teachers' concerns as a ""political opinion,"" adding that the government always welcomed ""criticism, contribution, observations and comments"" from ""professional organizations.""

'Migrant' and 'Soros' are schoolyard taunts

Miklosi, who has reviewed school textbooks for more than 30 years, believes Orban's anti-migrant rhetoric has filtered down to classrooms and playgrounds.

""'Migrant' has become a swear word for many people, including many children,"" he said.

Should a teacher say the words ""Jewish"" or ""gypsy"" or ""Slovak"" they are often met with students ""giggling and nudging each other"" and the teacher has to ""actively fight for space to discuss these categories in a neutral way,"" Miklosi added.

Miklosi has campaigned for changes to the 2016 Year Eight History book, and some edits -- such as a decription of right and left-wing politics -- have since been made, while many other criticisms remain.

It's a view shared by English teacher Juli Karolyi, who said for some students the words ""migrant"" and ""Soros"" had become ""swear words used in schoolyards and playground conflicts.""

But she added that children's views were ""mostly decided in the home"" rather than in the pages of textbooks. ""If the parents fall for the government propaganda, the kids will follow suit -- especially the younger ones,"" she said.

A few blocks from Miklosi's inner-city office, 18-year-old student Akos Blaskovics has just finished a morning history class at his high school, Fazekas Mihály Gimnázium. The quietly-spoken teenager told CNN that he ""hasn't really seen a difference in the messages of textbooks in recent years.""

But he did think the government has tried to ""make people focus on the question of migrants,"" rather than ""more important things like education, healthcare and social problems.""

Five textbook publishers, 123 trials

In a small village 30 minutes' drive east of Budapest, publisher András Romankovics' home office is packed with bookshelf after bookshelf of rainbow-colored spines arranged by decade.

The former teacher and his wife started publishing school textbooks in 1978, and he estimates around 10 million copies have been printed over the years.

Hungarian school textbook licenses must be renewed every five years. Romankovics is one of five independent textbook publishers who are suing the government after it rejected their requests to extend their licenses, which were due to expire at the end of 2018.

Former teacher András Romankovics first started publishing school textbooks in the 1970s.

The court case relates to 123 books in total -- meaning 123 separate trials for each book. Needless to say it's a lengthy process, and since the trials began in September, around 20 books have been granted permission to extend their licenses, said Romankovics.

Meanwhile the licenses of state-sponsored textbooks were extended, he said.

Kovacs, the government spokesman, would not comment on why the government had rejected the independent textbook publishers' license requests, saying only that it was an ""ongoing case"" and ""going through a higher level of decision-making.""

But Romankovics, who is also chair of the National Textbook Association, which represents 20 publishers, warned that without a true diversity of books, children's education would suffer.

'There is a deeper problem here'

While independent publishers battle to keep their textbooks in schools, university professors are battling to keep their programs in Hungary.

Inside the grand, high-ceilinged offices of Budapest's CEU, gender studies associate professor Eva Fodor is dismayed that the government has scrapped her program which has been running for over 20 years.

The university offers US- and Hungarian-accredited gender studies degrees -- or at least it did, until the government struck gender studies from its list of accredited programs in October.

Gender studies professor Eva Fodor has seen her Hungarian degree scrapped under government changes.

While the US-accredited program will continue in Vienna, the Hungarian-accredited degree no longer exists, affecting around 45 MA students enrolling each year, said Fodor. The only other Hungarian university to offer gender studies -- Eötvös Loránd (ELTE) -- was also forced to scrap its program.

""It's a clear and unprecedented violation of academic freedom,"" said Fodor, adding that it wasn't just gender studies that didn't fit with Orban's world view.

""It indicates that there is a deeper problem here,"" she said. Orban wants to create a strong ideology that people can hold on to, based on ""national pride and his idea of very simple Christian values,"" Fodor said. ""And (he's) eliminating everyone else who is not willing to subscribe to this ideology,"" she added.

According to Kovacs, gender studies degrees were scrapped because of low enrollment, scarce job opportunities, and the government's ""philosophical approach.""

""We believe there are only two sexes -- men and women,"" he said. Kovacs added that students were still free to research gender issues from the perspective of other disciplines, such as philosophy or sociology. ""But we don't believe that gender is an independent discipline in itself.""

cnn,Pope Francis asked to go vegan for Lent for $1 million charity donation,['Emily Dixon'],"(CNN) An environmental campaign group has called on Pope Francis to take up veganism for Lent, in exchange for $1 million donated to the charity of his choice.

""I write to you today with the utmost respect and appreciation for your speaking out on climate change, habitat loss, and pollution, and for reminding the world that Earth is a home we all share,"" Butler wrote in the letter, which was published in national newspapers around the world.

Butler cited Pope Francis's 2015 encyclical "" Laudato si ,"" in which he called for ""changes of lifestyle, production and consumption"" to protect the environment. Climate change, he said, ""represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day,"" and will disproportionately affect the world's poorest people.

""With 815 million people suffering from malnutrition, imagine how many hungry people we could feed across the world if we moved away from such wasteful foods,"" she said.

From Long Beach, California, Butler turned vegan at the age of six and subsequently began to advocate for animal rights. At 10, she gave a TED talk on the environmental impact of consuming animal products.

Million Dollar Vegan, supported by celebrities including Paul McCartney, Woody Harrelson and Mena Suvari, promotes veganism as a means of tackling world hunger, climate change and animal suffering.

""Moving towards a plant-based diet will have substantial environmental benefits. It will protect our land, trees, oceans, and air, and help feed the world's most vulnerable,"" Butler wrote. ""We need to take action, and we need the support of influential leaders like yourself.""

This year, the Christian period of Lent begins on March 6 and ends on April 18. If Pope Francis accepts Butler's challenge, $1 million will be donated to his selected charity by the Blue Horizon International Foundation , a US non-profit that aims to ""accelerate the removal of animals from the global food chain.""

cnn,"UAE 'recklessly' supplying Yemeni militias with foreign arms, Amnesty reports",['Eliza Mackintosh'],"(CNN) The United Arab Emirates is ""recklessly"" supplying militias and other factions waging war in Yemen with an array of advanced weaponry, according to an investigation published by Amnesty International on Wednesday.

The report, citing open-source evidence, details how the UAE has become what Amnesty described as a ""major conduit"" for armored vehicles, mortar systems and guns that are being sent to groups accused of war crimes.

Amnesty's report comes on the heels of an on-the-ground CNN investigation , published Monday, which revealed that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- its main partner in the war -- have transferred American-made weapons to al Qaeda-linked fighters, hardline Salafi militias, and other groups, in violation of their agreements with the United States. The US Department of Defense tells CNN that those countries are legally obligated to obtain authorization from the U.S. government prior to transferring the equipment to any third party. That authorization was never obtained.

After CNN presented its findings, a US defense official confirmed there was an ongoing investigation into the issue.

CNN's report also found that US weapons had made their way into the hands of Iranian-backed rebels battling the Saudi-led coalition, exposing some of America's sensitive military technology to Tehran and potentially endangering the lives of US troops in other conflict zones.

""While the USA, the UK, France and other European states have rightly been criticized for supplying arms to Coalition forces, and Iran has been implicated in sending arms to the Houthis, a deadly new threat is emerging. Yemen is quickly becoming a safe haven for UAE-backed militias that are largely unaccountable,"" Patrick Wilcken, arms control and human rights researcher at Amnesty International, said in a statement.

""Emirati forces receive billions of dollars' worth of arms from Western states and others, only to siphon them off to militias in Yemen that answer to no one and are known to be committing war crimes.""

An American-made MRAP in the hands of the Giants Brigade militia in Yemen.

From 2001 to 2017, the US has made over $22 billion in arms agreements, but has actually sold and delivered over $6 billion in weapons to the UAE, according to the US Department of Defense.

The US is not alone in selling arms to the UAE. A number of European countries -- along with Australia, China and South Africa, among others -- have supplied the UAE with over $3.5 billion worth of arms since the Yemeni conflict began in March 2015, according to Amnesty, citing data from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and UN Comtrade.

'Wide variety of US-supplied vehicles' in militia hands

Footage, images, and social media posts from the battle for Yemen's flashpoint city of Hodeidah, analyzed by Amnesty International, showed that military vehicles and weapons supplied to the UAE by the US and others are now in the hands of militias on the ground.

The report details ""a wide variety of US-supplied armored vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns"" in the hands of the Giants Brigade, a predominantly Salafi, or ultra-conservative Sunni, militia, as well as UAE-backed militias Security Belt and Shabwani elite forces.

Militias in Hodeidah were also documented using the Agrab armoured-truck-mounted Singaporean 120mm mortar system, which is made in South Africa. The UAE is the only country known to have purchased this combined weapon system, according to Amnesty International.

As revealed on Monday, a CNN team on the ground in Hodeidah witnessed the Giants Brigade in possession of several American-made Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. One even had the export label showing it was sent from Beaumont, Texas to Abu Dhabi, in the UAE, before ending up in the hands of the militia.

And in September 2017, a Houthi-run television channel broadcast images of Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the de facto rebel leader, proudly sitting behind the wheel of a US-made MRAP in the capital Sanaa, as a crowd chanted ""death to America"" in the background.

By handing off such military equipment to third parties, some of the countries that make up the Saudi-led coalition are breaking the terms of their legal arms deals with the US, according to the Department of Defense.

The Saudi coalition did not respond to multiple requests for comment ahead of the publication of CNN's investigation Monday. A senior UAE official denied ""in no uncertain terms"" that it had violated its end-use agreements with the US.

The Giants Brigade is a ""part of Yemeni forces,"" the UAE official told CNN, adding that the group was under the direct supervision of the UAE and, therefore, the equipment was in the ""collective possession"" of the coalition.

On Tuesday, the top US military commander in the Middle East, Gen. Joseph Votel, told a US Senate hearing: ""We have not authorized Saudi Arabia or the Emirates to retransfer any of this equipment to other parties on the ground in Yemen.""

""And as you are well aware, when we do provide equipment, whether it comes government to government or commercially provided, that they recipients do have to agree to certain stipulations on the use of those and that we do have monitoring and enforcement mechanisms,"" he added.

Votel also said that the US would be looking closely at CNN's findings.

Amnesty: Stop supplying weapons to UAE

For many states, supplying weaponry to the UAE violates the global Arms Trade Treaty, which regulates the international trade in conventional arms, Amnesty International says. The transfers are also in breach of EU law, and, in many instances, domestic laws of suppliers.

In its report, Amnesty International has called on states to stop supplying arms to all parties to the conflict in Yemen.

""Only a handful of countries have done the right thing and stopped the conveyor belt of arms to the Yemen's devastating conflict. Others must follow in their footsteps or they will share responsibility for the devastating toll these billions of dollars' worth of arms transfers are wreaking on civilians in Yemen,"" Wilcken said.

Saturday is the deadline for US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to re-certify to Congress that Saudi and the UAE are taking adequate measures to avoid harming civilians, thereby allowing US-provided aerial refueling services to the coalition to continue.

""This investigation needs to be a wake-up call,"" US senator Chris Murphy said Tuesday, referring to CNN's report. ""Congress should immediately pass our bipartisan War Powers Resolution to get us out of the war in Yemen that has gone horribly wrong, and we must stop selling weapons to help Saudi Arabia and the UAE continue to perpetuate this disastrous war.""

cnn,The most important moments from the Pope's visit to the United Arab Emirates,['Delia Gallagher'],"(CNN) Pope Francis' trip to the United Arab Emirates was a delicate journey: the first Pope in the Arabian peninsula, the birthplace of Islam and a region mired in religious and geopolitical conflicts.

But the Pope did not shirk the weight of his moral duty to speak out on behalf of the innocent in Yemen, of immigrant workers without citizenship, of religious minorities without full freedoms.

It was Pope Francis' seventh visit to a predominantly Muslim country, signaling a continuation of the Vatican's aim of improving ties between Catholics and the Islamic world.

Here are some of the most important moments from Francis' 40-hour trip to the United Arab Emirates.

On Yemen

From the window at the Vatican on Sunday, just an hour before leaving for the United Arab Emirates, a country helping Saudi Arabia fight a war in Yemen, Pope Francis called on those involved to respect international peace accords.

""Let us pray loudly,"" Francis said, ""because there are children that are hungry, are thirsty, don't have medicine and their lives are in danger.""

The Pope was greeted at the airport by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and the Pope and the Prince met in private discussions.

While it is unknown whether the Pope raised the issue with the Crown Prince, the emirate's Minister of State for Foregin Affairs, Anwar Gargash, said in a tweet that he ""welcomed"" the pontiff's prayer, calling on 2019 to be ""the year of peace"" in Yemen.

The Pope returned to the topic of Yemen in his speech Monday night at the Founder's Memorial, when he spoke about the ""miserable crudeness"" of war.

""Human fraternity requires of us, as representatives of the world's religions, the duty to reject every nuance of approval from the word 'war,'"" the Pope said.

""I am thinking particularly of Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Libya,"" Francis said.

Citizenship for Christians

""I look forward to societies where people of different beliefs have the same right of citizenship,"" Francis said to a gathering of religious and political leaders, touching on a sensitive question for his host country as well as the rest of the Middle East.

Citizenship was also mentioned in a joint declaration signed by the Pope and Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Egypt-based Al-Azhar, one of Sunni Islam's most important centers of scholarship.

""The concept of citizenship is based on the equality of rights and duties, under which all enjoy justice. It is therefore crucial to establish in our societies the concept of full citizenship and reject the discriminatory use of the term minorities, which engenders feelings of isolation and inferiority,"" reads the ""Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together.""

Citizenship for non-Muslims, including Christians, is strictly curtailed if not effectively banned in several Muslim countries, according to human rights groups. Taking up the issue and getting a leader as prominent as el-Tayeb to sign a document promising change can be seen as a diplomatic coup for the Pope.

Women

The document also promises changes on another contentious topic within Islam, the role of women.

""Efforts must be made to modify those laws that prevent women from fully enjoying their rights,"" wrote the Pope and el-Tayeb.

""It is an essential requirement to recognize the right of women to education and employment and to recognize the freedom to exercise their own political rights.""

The Pope said the document was a year in the making, with Francis and the Grand Imam confidentially sending drafts back and forth between them.

The move effectively blocks the passage of humanitarian aid called for by Venezuela's opposition, should it be delivered via this route.

New images show an orange oil tanker and two large blue containers positioned midway across the three-lane Tienditas Bridge, which connects Cucuta, Colombia, with Venezuela.

Cucuta is one of three collection points for international humanitarian aid called for by Venezuela's opposition leader and self-declared president Juan Guaido amid Venezuela's debilitating economic crisis.

Last week, Guaido identified the three collection points: the Brazil-Venezuela border, an as-of-yet unidentified Caribbean island, and Cucuta.

cnn,Toronto police went to arrest a man they suspected of murder. They found a man tied to his bed.,['Emanuella Grinberg'],"(CNN) When Toronto police moved to arrest a man they suspected of being a serial killer last year, they found a man tied to his bed. Alive.

Police then searched the suspect's hard drive for evidence. There, they discovered eight folders labeled with the names of different men. Each folder contained photos of the men -- some alive and some dead -- with their naked bodies posed in fur coats or with unlit cigars.

There was a ninth folder, too. It was labeled with the name of the man tied to the bed.

Those macabre details were made public by Crown attorney Michael Cantlon this week as part of the criminal sentencing of Bruce McArthur, who lured lured the men to his home, strangled them and then dismembered them, according to CNN network partner CTV News

McArthur, 67, pleaded guilty on January 29 to eight counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Andrew Kinsman, Selim Esen, Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Mahmudi, Dean Lisowick, Skandaraj Navaratnam, Abdulbasir Faizi and Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam.

Prosecutors said last week they were pleased with the guilty plea but have declined to provide further details about the case.

""[As] this matter is currently before the court, it would be inappropriate for the ministry to comment further,"" said Brian Gray, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Attorney General.

McArthur buried the remains of the men in garden planters and in a ravine next to a property where he stored tools for his landscaping business, Cantlon said , according to CTV.

Police had been monitoring McArthur and decided to arrest him on January 18, 2018, when he brought the man to his apartment, according to CTV.

McArthur, who also worked as a mall Santa , was arrested and charged with two murders. The Crown added more charges as the investigation unfolded.

Prosecutor: Victims were exploited for their vulnerabilities

Most of the victims were immigrants of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, Cantlon told the court. Some were from Toronto's Gay Village neighborhood and had ties to the city's LGBTQ community.

""Most of the deceased had traits that made victimization more likely or harder to detect. Some were forced to live parts of their life in secret because of their orientation. Some lacked stable housing,"" Cantlon said, according to CTV.

""There is evidence that Mr. McArthur sought out and exploited these vulnerabilities to continue his crimes undetected.""

The Crown believes that McArthur killed his first victim , Navaratnam, in September 2010. After his final victim, Andrew Kinsman, went missing in June 2017, law enforcement began investigating McArthur.

Investigators found a calendar inside Kinsman's apartment with the name ""Bruce"" written on June 26, 2017, the day Kinsman went missing, according to CTV

Surveillance footage from Kinsman's neighborhood showed him entering a red Dodge Caravan identified as belonging to McArthur. Inside the vehicle, which was later discovered in a scrapyard, investigators found DNA that matched Kinsman and Esen.

The photos on McArthur's computer -- some of which were taken when the men were alive -- showed that the victims were ""restrained and sexually assaulted,"" Cantlon said.

Some photos showed the murder weapon -- a metal bar with a rope that McArthur used to strangle his victims -- around victims' necks, Cantlon said.

In addition to the photos, police found the victims' jewelry in McArthur's home, Cantlon said. A duffel bag in the apartment contained duct tape, a surgical glove, rope, zip ties, a black bungee cord, and syringes, according to CTV

'It could have been me'

Abdulbasir Faizi

Faizi was reported missing on December 29, 2010, Kayhan was reported missing in October 2012, and Mahmudi was reported missing in August 2015.

Kanagaratnam moved from Sri Lanka to Canada in 2010. He was not reported missing. Police said he was likely killed sometime between September and December 2015.

Esen, who had no fixed address, was reported missing in April 2017.

The court heard victim impact statements from those who knew Esen and others, CTV reported.

""Our lives were shattered with the shocking news. We can't come to terms with his savage murder,"" sister Nadia Wali said in a statement on behalf of the Esen family.

Lisowick was not reported missing, but authorities believe he was killed sometime between May 2016 and July 2017. A Crown attorney read aloud a statement from a daughter who never met him.

""I will now always have to live with knowing I will never have a relationship with my father,"" Emily Bourgeois said.

Some of Kinsman's friends told the court they knew McArthur.

""I feel incredibly guilty for not being able to recognize the offender for who he was,"" CTV quoted Kinsman's friend Adrian Betts as saying.

""By killing my friend, this man has also killed who I was before all of this horror.""

The Rev. Deana Dudley of the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto said in court that McArthur's arrest would have a ""deep and lasting"" impact on the LGBTQ community, according to CTV.

""Many in our community have lost their sense of safety. ... There is a sense of 'it could have been me, it could have been any of us,'"" Dudley said.

cnn,Juan Guiado recognized as interim Venezuelan president by European nations,['Eliza Mackintosh'],"(CNN) A group of major European nations recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's interim president on Monday, urging him to hold free and fair elections.

The coordinated move came after President Nicolas Maduro ignored a demand set by some EU nations to call snap elections by the end of Sunday. Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Germany were among the European nations to recognize Guaido's legitimacy.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez speaks about Venezuela at the Moncloa Palace on Monday.

""We will dedicate all our efforts to achieve peace, freedom and harmony of the Venezuelan people,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said. He called on Guaido to hold ""free, democratic presidential elections, with guarantees and without exclusions.""

British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter that the UK would recognize Guaido as interim president ""until credible elections can be held."" A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May added that sanctions against Venezuela were also on the table, underlining that the Maduro regime must end.

Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Estonia and Sweden also said they would recognize Guaido as Venezuela's interim president.

Speaking to reporters outside the National Assembly in Caracas on Monday, Guaido said the recognition he has received from some EU countries was meaningful for all Venezuelans.

""This recognition from more than 20 countries is a recognition for all you Venezuelans who never stopped fighting and we will never stop doing it until we achieve our democracy and freedom in Venezuela,"" said Guaido.

Nicolas Maduro has not called Presidential elections within 8 day limit we have set. So UK alongside European allies now recognises @jguaido as interim constitutional president until credible elections can be held. Let's hope this takes us closer to ending humanitarian crisis — Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) February 4, 2019

Venezuela's Foreign Ministry denounced the groundswell of support for Guaido, suggesting that European governments were acting as part of a US-led effort to topple Maduro.

""The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela categorically rejects decision adopted by some European governments, where they officially fold into this strategy led by the US administration to topple the legitimate government of President Nicolas Maduro -- who the people of Venezuela elected in a sovereign, free and democratic way,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

A crowd surrounds Juan Guaido during a protest against Maduro on Saturday.

Maduro rejected the ""ultimatum"" set by EU leaders, asserting that previous elections that ushered him into another six-year term were fair. ""We don't accept ultimatums from anyone,"" Maduro said in an interview with Spanish TV network LaSexta on Sunday.

It was not clear why the EU as a whole did not recognize Guaido. Speaking in Brussels on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that while the EU never recognized Venezuela's elections last year as legitimate, the decision to recognize a head of state was up to individual EU members alone.

A 'political and peaceful process'

EU leaders have hailed a newly formed "" international contact group ,"" which will meet in Montevideo, Uruguay, on Thursday to discuss a ""political and peaceful process"" to ending the Venezuela crisis.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that France supported the group of EU and Latin American countries and their role in Venezuela's transition period, after recognizing Guaido as ""acting President"" in a tweet.

Juan Guaido waves to thousands of his at a rally in the capital Caracas on Saturday.

Speaking on France Inter radio on Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the decision to recognize Guaido was ""not foreign meddling,"" as Russia, one of Maduro's key allies, has suggested.

Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned Europe's interference in the oil-rich country on Monday, calling it an attempt to ""legitimize the usurped authority.""

Les Vénézuéliens ont le droit de s'exprimer librement et démocratiquement. La France reconnaît @jguaido comme « président en charge » pour mettre en œuvre un processus électoral. Nous soutenons le Groupe de contact, créé avec l'UE, dans cette période de transition. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) February 4, 2019

Russia and China, which have together invested billions of dollars into Venezuela, have continued to back Maduro.

China said on Monday that, no matter the outcome of the current political crisis, cooperation with Venezuela would not be damaged

Humanitarian aid

Since declaring himself acting president on January 23 -- invoking a constitutional rule to open a rare challenge to Maduro's presidency -- Guaido's leadership had already been recognized by Canada, the United States, Australia, and a number of Latin American countries.

On Monday, Canada hosted a meeting of the Lima Group regional bloc to discuss how the international community can further aid the people of Venezuela, including through immediate humanitarian assistance.

Opening a session in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a contribution of 53 million Canadian dollars ($40.4 million) in aid to Venezuela.

The group also issued a statement welcoming Venezuela's interim government as a full member, and called on the country's armed forces to show loyalty to Guaido, according to Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland.

Guaido supporters hold huge Venezuelan flags during a protest against Maduro on Saturday.

Earlier in the day, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany had earmarked €5 million ($5.72 million) worth of assistance for Venezuela. Later on Monday, Guaido said that Germany has pledged €6 million ($6.86 million.)

USAID has already begun packaging pallets of foodstuffs following national security adviser John Bolton's announcement last week that it would send humanitarian aid.

Guaido has said that humanitarian aid will begin to flow into Venezuela in the coming days, defying Maduro's repeated refusal of assistance in the face of food and medicine shortages. He outlined the move as part of a plan to push the military into cooperating with the opposition.

Focusing on the need for aid, Guaido told reporters: ""This is an emergency, it's a crisis. We are announcing this immediately and making the determination for this to enter the country and for it to be distributed efficiently and where it is most needed.""

Appealing to the conscience of Venezuela's military to help get humanitarian aid into the country, Guaido said on Twitter: ""Everything is ready. The question here is to all military officers: Soldier, are you going to deny your family humanitarian aid? I appeal once again to your conscience; this aid is to save lives.""

In addition to focusing on aid, Guaido also said his team would focus on demanding a freeze on Venezuelan assets in the EU.

Maduro has repeatedly denied that Venezuela is in a crisis, suggesting aid efforts were part of an international plan to destabilize his socialist regime. During Maduro's tenure as president, the once-wealthy oil nation has descended into economic collapse and a humanitarian crisis.

On Monday, Guaido paid his respects to the victims of the recent protests in Caracas, saying 69 people had been killed so far this year in the country for political reasons.

He also said there is no possibility of a civil war. ""This is a farce, which Maduro wants to try to sell.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/04/americas/europe-guaido-venezuela-president-intl/index.html,2019-02-04 00:00:00

cnn,Climate change is the biggest risk to business,"['Ivana Kottasová', 'Cnn Business']","London (CNN Business) Companies and investors are waking up to the dangers posed by climate change and extreme weather.

Many now consider environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires, to be even more dangerous than turbulent markets, cyberattacks or geopolitical snafus.

Climate and environmental issues dominate a ranking of top global risks produced by the World Economic Forum ahead of its annual summit in Davos

Business leaders and experts surveyed by WEF said that extreme weather, migration caused by climate change and natural disasters are the three risks they're most likely to face in 2019.

Each of the climate-related risks also ranks among the top five issues in terms of potential impact.

""There is more investor pressure and more requirements on companies,"" said John Drzik, president of global risk and digital at insurance broker Marsh. ""They have been already facing pressure from consumers to make their products more climate friendly, but the amplified investor pressure is new.""

Wildfires hit California last year.

Climate risks

Natural disasters and extreme weather caused around $160 billion worth of damage in 2018, according to reinsurance company Munich RE. Control Risks, a consultancy, predicts that figure will be surpassed in 2019.

""From storms to floods to droughts and forest fires, the costs of interrupted production, distribution, sales and travel will skyrocket in 2019,"" the group said in its annual risk report.

JUST WATCHED Tense climate talks end in agreement Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tense climate talks end in agreement 02:19

Climate disasters point to several areas where businesses face increased risks.

The first is supply chains. A report from University of Maryland and software firm Resilinc showed that global supply chain disruptions caused by weather doubled in 2017.

The risk doesn't affect just the developing world, where infrastructure is often weaker. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria combined that year to make the United States the most disrupted region for the first time.

The most dramatic example of a company coming under pressure from risks related to the environment is Pacific Gas and Electric.

The California utility company is facing billions of dollars in claims over the deadly 2018 Camp Fire, and it said earlier this week that it would file for bankruptcy on January 29.

The company cited at least $7 billion in claims from the Camp Fire, which caused 86 deaths and destroyed 14,000 homes. It is believed the fire was started when a PG&E power line came in contact with nearby trees.

In the bankruptcy filing, the company cited the ""significant increase in wildfire risk resulting from climate change"" as one of the reasons for its decision.

""We simply wouldn't be seeing the catastrophic weather events we've witnessed in recent years if not for the amplifying effect of climate change,"" said Michael Mann, director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center.

Hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle in October.

Business response

Top investors are demanding that more companies draw up environmental action plans. They're also asking CEOs to consider risks to their business caused by shifting consumer attitudes toward climate change.

Alison Martin, the chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Group, said it doesn't matter whether the company's leadership ""believes in climate change or [what they think] the causes of it are.""

""If you were a plastic straws manufacturer a few years ago thinking about your strategy going forward, maybe you weren't anticipating that consumer sentiment could so quickly and so radically move against you,"" she said.

Shareholders are becoming increasingly vocal.

Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund launched a big push for sustainability in September, saying it will be using its power as the world's biggest stock holder to influence companies to behave more responsibly.

In a landmark climate report last year, the United Nations last year called for ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society."" It warned the world has only 12 years to avert a climate disaster.

Drzik said the UN timeline made companies wake up to the urgency.

""View of risks tends to be dominated by the short-term horizon, and climate is still seen as more long-term than geopolitical risk ... but that report has started to pull more focus on it,"" he said.

Maersk ( AMKBY ), the world's biggest shipping company, recently said it's aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050 and urged other shipping companies to do the same.

Companies in Europe, Mexico, Japan and Canada could add tens of billions of dollars in export orders if the conflict drags on, according to a study released this week by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

""The effect of US-China tariffs would be mainly distortionary,"" said Pamela Coke-Hamilton, head of UNCTAD's international trade division. ""US-China bilateral trade will decline and be replaced by trade originating in other countries.""

The study warned that the tariffs ""do little to help domestic firms"" in the United States and China. And even if they end up benefiting exporters in other countries, they also risk setting off a damaging sequence of negative effects around the world.

""Nobody died from working hard,"" Gwala told CNN after his monster morning training block.

By 7 a.m., Gwala is in the kitchen making breakfast for his two children before heading off to work. Afterward, he'll throw in a 3km swim.

At the age of 27, Gwala should be in his prime for his sport of choice: triathlon.

Except he isn't, after being attacked at gunpoint by three men, who according to Gwala, then pulled out a chainsaw, and began to saw into his legs.

Humble beginnings

Gwala grew up at the foothills of the rural South African village of Ndwedwe, to a family of cow herders. On these large swaths of barren land, he learned to run -- chasing cows and classmates. A self-described rebel, he would often swim in the forbidden river in the valley.

Mhlengi Gwala in his hometown, Ndwewe, South Africa.

""If I want to get strong, I come and train here,"" Gwala told CNN, as he glanced up at the massive mountains of his hometown. Today, he's here visiting his family. But first, a run.

Jogging up the steep dirt trails, he pointed out his primary school, a stone's throw from his childhood home. From there, he said he would organize running races with no knowledge of the total course distance, and no prize other than the satisfaction to participate.

Today his training is much more disciplined. Every kilometer calculated; every pace clocked.

Gwala moved to neighboring Chesterville for university. It wasn't long before he fell in with a bad crowd and began dabbling in drugs and alcohol.

""I told my mom, 'I want to stop [going to school] because I'm wasting your money,"" he said. ""I had developed a drug and alcohol problem.""

Failing at university and staring at liver failure, the then 22-year-old Gwala said he had to make a drastic lifestyle change if he wanted to see 30.

Unsure of what direction to go, a friend suggested he try out for a lifesaving job, since he knew how to swim and it'd be a healthy lifestyle choice.

After two weeks of grueling tryouts in the pool, he landed the job.

""I fell in love with lifesaving and I decided I have to start doing [this],"" Gwala said.

This profession didn't completely cover the bills at first, so he moonlighted at a factory -- a job which he ran to -- and from -- every day. He credits that commute for his speediness.

Mhlengi Gwala wins the South Africa Lifesaving Championships.

He joined Durban's Marine Surf Lifesaving Club and began competing in beach swim-run events. After winning two races, including the South Africa Lifesaving Championships, he realized he could swim and run pretty well, so why not add in biking and try a triathlon?

A triathlete is born

In 2015, Gwala started placing in his age group in local triathlons. Later that year, he was invited to the US to represent South Africa in the ITU World Triathlon Grand Final in Chicago.

Two weeks before the big race, he was in a bike crash. Still, he competed and came in 57th place in his age group.

Making strides for his country, competing again in the ITU World Finals in 2017, and competing in longer distances -- like Ironman 70.3 events, Gwala was starting to get serious about triathlon.

The life altering attack

Except ""people tried to stop my career,"" said Gwala, though fighting back tears he's unable to say much more about the life altering attack that changed everything.

In March 2018, during his routine early morning ride near the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Gwala was attacked at gunpoint by three men and pulled into a nearby bush.

According to Gwala, they began shouting at him in a foreign language and then pulled out the chainsaw.

The men managed to cut through 90% of his tibia, and 80% of the surrounding tissue on his right leg, according to Dr. O'Sharran Singh.

Gwala suffered the horrific chainsaw attack in March 2018.

It made some lacerations to the left leg, but miraculously, the chainsaw seemingly stopped working and the men ran away, according to Gwala.

He was rushed to the hospital, where his doctors were able to save his leg. But they told him it would be two years before he could run again.

Five months after surgery, Gwala was running again. Today he's running up to 6km. It may not be fast, or pretty; he likens it to how a crab would run, but aesthetics don't concern him.

Getting back on his feet

""The first time we got him on the treadmill running it was very emotional,"" said Jarrod Rudolph, his physical therapist at Prime Human Performance Institute in Durban.

""For us to get him to achieve that in a five to six month period post-op was a remarkable thing and it really boils down to his attitude,"" Rudolph commented.

It's still a very long road to his recovery. The nerve damage may take up to two years to heal, according to Team South Africa's Olympic doctor Kevin Shubban.

But, remarkably, Gwala is doing everything he was doing before, just with a limp.

Road to the Paralympics

Gwala has qualified as a para-athlete. His goal now is to compete at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic games in either the paracycling or paratriathlon events.

""That is my big motivation. That makes me wake up every morning because I need to get strong if I'm going there, and make South Africa proud of me,"" he said, ""I'm hungry for success, ha ha.""

Another big motivator for Gwala is Olympian Josia Thugwane, the first black athlete to earn an Olympic gold for South Africa.

August 1996: Josia Thugwane of South Africa after winning the men's marathon at the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia.

Thugwane was shot five months before he was set to compete in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. The bullet grazed his chin, and injured his back. Defying all odds, he made an amazing recovery and went on to win the marathon.

""Whenever I'm going to race I have to watch his documentary. He makes me feel strong.""

To this day, Gwala has a hard time talking about the chainsaw incident. He still doesn't understand why he was attacked, nor do the police who say they are no closer to catching his assailants.

""I forgive them. I can't forget. I'll always remember. Every day, every hour,"" he said, ""but I won't remember it as a bad thing.""

Alcohol took his life away. Triathlon gave it back. This attack may have slowed Gwala down, but he's more determined now than ever to make it to the top.

That's why he trains day after day, training not just for himself or his family, but for his country and for a goal that's bigger than himself: Tokyo in 2020.",https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/06/sport/triathlete-chainsaw-attack-makes-comeback-spt-intl/index.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
cnn,Real Madrid face Barcelona in Copa del Rey semifinal,['Matias Grez'],"(CNN) For all the talk of Real Madrid's season being in crisis, Los Blancos are now just three games away from securing a major trophy.

After suffering three consecutive La Liga defeats in October, the third -- the 5-1 Clasico loss to Barcelona -- proved to be the final straw for Julen Lopetegui, Real have recently started to show signs of life in the post-Cristiano Ronaldo era.

The mini resurgence under Lopetegui's successor Santiago Solari, which has seen the club climb to within two points of second place Atletico Madrid and reach the Champions League last 16, will face the ultimate test Wednesday as Real travel to the Camp Nou to again face arch-rivals Barca in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal.

Solari, who has overseen a run of seven wins in the last eight games, will be boosted by the news Barca talisman Lionel Messi is unlikely to feature after suffering a thigh injury in Saturday's draw against Valencia.

Barcelona are likely to be without the injured Lionel Messi for the first leg.

The Argentine is set to undergo further tests ahead of Wednesday's match but reports suggested he trained apart from his teammates on Monday.

""For me there are two predictions: One with Messi, one without Messi,"" Marca journalist Juan Castro tells CNN Sport. ""Without Messi I think both teams have the same possibility (of reaching the final).

""But with Messi, which isn't very likely right now, the clear favorite is Barcelona. Both teams arrive at the game with a good feeling, Solari has recovered a lot, (Karim) Benzema has an unbelievable recent record and Vinicius is the new sensation of Real.""

Ronaldo-less Real's troubles

Benzema's recent resurgence has seen him score six goals in his last four games, with the Frenchman previously having scored just twice in 13 matches.

It's that inconsistency in front of goal which has blighted Real this season, as well as a leaky backline, with Benzema being forced to single-handedly shoulder the responsibility of replacing Ronaldo's 50+ goals every season in Gareth Bale's continued absence through injury.

The failure to adequately replace the Portuguese star, who joined Juventus in July for a reported $117 million transfer fee, falls squarely at the feet of Real president Florentino Perez, Castro says, despite Lopetegui being made the fall guy.

""Real's troubles this season haven't only been due to Ronaldo's absence, but the main reason is his absence,"" Castro says. ""Real made some mistakes in their preparation for this season but the biggest one was permitting Cristiano to leave -- and for that money.

""The second mistake was not signing a replacement for him, one or two players, and the third one was not creating another figure to supply all these goals in the striker's position.

""It's clear than Benzema is replacing him in the sense that he is scoring more goals than any other player, but this is not enough to replace such big figures that Cristiano posted.""

Though it's clear Real Madrid have made some improvements on the pitch under Solari, now at least looking more likely than not to win each game they play, Castro remains unconvinced on the impact the Argentine coach has had on the team.

""I don't think it's a question of names, I think it was a question of time,"" Castro explains. ""In the sense that if Loptegui had stayed longer, he probably would have won all these matches as Solari has.

""But Lopetegui did not have the right amount of time. I don't think it was his fault, I think it was a question of time and not a question of what Solari has brought to that team because if you go into the details, Solari has lost a lot of games as well.

Santiago Solari's introduction of Vinicius Junior and Sergio Reguilon to the starting XI has brought Real some success.

""I will say the big detail from Solari's side was to bring fresh blood to the team like Vinicius and Sergio Reguilon, which is very important because in his place was Marcelo who was untouchable.

""Solari had the courage to put Reguilon instead of Marcelo, so two big decisions and the third one was to play Lucas more than Gareth Bale. I think those three were big decisions were for Solari.""

Champions League? 'Why not?'

Despite a problematic and largely underwhelming season so far, Castro believes there is a ""high chance"" Real can win one or more trophies this season.

While any hope of winning just a second La Liga title in seven years has long since evaporated, Real's know-how in knockout competitions, particularly the Champions League, mean it's hard to discount them from potentially securing the double.

Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his fifth Champions League trophy after beating Liverpool last season.

""La Liga is obviously lost,"" Castro says. ""The Copa of course, they have only three games ahead to win the title, so of course it's possible and even more without Messi in the first match.

""And the Champions League, why not? I mean, some of the Champions League titles in Real Madrid's history have been in the worse moments than this particular season.

""Real Madrid on the big stage really are superior, they have a superior mentality, they grow a lot, so you can never so no to Real.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/05/football/barcelona-real-madrid-el-clasico-copa-del-rey-semi-final-first-leg-preview-spt-itnl/index.html,2019-02-05 00:00:00
cnn,"Skiing World Championships: Vonn, Shiffrin, Hirscher among talking points in Sweden",['Rob Hodgetts'],"(CNN) It's ski racing's biggest event outside the Olympics and comes with the cachet of a world title to wear with pride for the next two years.

Alpine skiing's FIS World Championships take place in Are, Sweden over the next two weeks with legends to be forged, names to be made and scores to be settled.

The event will also mark the end of an era -- American great Lindsey Vonn will retire from ski racing after Sunday's downhill because of the ravages the sport and its spills have taken on her body over the years. And fellow speedster Aksel Lund Svindal , Norway's Olympic downhill champion, is also bowing out following an illustrious but injury-plagued career.

But very much at the top of their games are slalom specialists Mikaela Shiffrin and Marcel Hirscher, both bidding to add more gloss to glittering careers and defend the world titles they won in St. Moritz, Switzerland two years ago.

Here's the top-five talking points for skiing's World Championships.

So long, Lindsey

The 34-year-old Vonn has enjoyed a stunning career and amassed a remarkable 82 World Cup victories to sit second on the all-time list behind Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark.

Can't thank everyone enough for the well wishes! 🙏🏻 It is helping me stay positive and has lifted my spirits. Looking forward to creating some lasting memories in my final races next week. ❤️ — lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 3, 2019

Despite a catalogue of injuries, she was determined to give it one final shot at passing Stenmark's record this season, but Vonn has finally succumbed to her ailing body.

""My body is broken beyond repair and it isn't letting me have the final season I dreamed of,"" she wrote on Facebook Friday. ""My body is screaming at me to STOP and it's time for me to listen.""

The American won super-G and downhill world titles in 2009, and fought back from injury to clinch bronze in the Olympic downhill in Pyeongchang in 2018 to add to downhill gold and super-G bronze in Vancouver in 2010. Despite only competing once this season because of a knee injury, a farewell world title is not beyond the realms of possibility.

But Vonn will still bid the sport goodbye as the most successful female ski racer of all time.

Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen She made her Olympic debut at Salt Lake City 2002 as a 17-year-old, finishing 32nd in slalom and sixth in the combined slalom/downhill event.

Hide Caption 3 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen In 2005, Vonn signed with Red Bull and began working with a completely new coaching team. She seemed set for the start of something special. Hide Caption 4 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Any momentum from the new deal was slowed during the 2006 Olympics in Italy, though. A fall in practice resulted in a short stay in hospital. She recovered in time to compete but could only manage seventh in the Super G and eighth in the downhill events. Hide Caption 5 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen However, Vonn quickly bounced back and won the first of three straight World Cup titles in 2008 at the age of 23. Hide Caption 6 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Golden girl Vonn achieved her Olympic dreams in 2010. She won the Olympic downhill gold at Whistler and added bronze in the super-G. Hide Caption 7 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Vonn added a fourth World Cup title in 2012, but is still behind Annemarie Moser-Proell's record of six overall crystal globes. Hide Caption 8 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Vonn's public profile went galactic when she dated star golfer Tiger Woods for two years between 2013 and 2015. Hide Caption 9 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen In 2013, Vonn suffered an horrific crash at the World Championships in Austria. She underwent reconstructive knee surgery and began a long road to recovery. She attempted to return a year later, only to pull out of the 2014 Olympics after aggravating the injury again. Hide Caption 10 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Injuries continued to hamper Vonn.

Svindal is one of the most dominant men's skiers of his generation with 36 World Cup wins and five world titles.

He won three medals, including super-G gold, at the Vancouver 2010 Games and became skiing's oldest gold medalist with victory in the blue riband downhill at the age of 35 last year.

A serious knee injury in a season-ending crash at Kitzbuhel in 2016 has left him unable to train much in recent seasons, reserving his efforts for race day.

He won a super-G at Val Gardena, Italy in December, but Svindal -- one of Norway's ""Attacking Vikings"" -- accepts the end is nigh.

Shining Shiffrin

Photos: Shiffrin's career so far American skier Mikaela Shiffrin is arguably the most dominant athlete in sport right now. The 23-year-old has taken skiing by storm this season, winning 13 World Cup races across four of the six disciplines to take her overall tally to 56 victories. Here's a look back at her short but sweet career so far. Hide Caption 1 of 13 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2011 – Shiffrin grew up skiing from an early age thanks to parents who were both competitive college skiers.

Hide Caption 7 of 13 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2015 – Following her Olympic success, the American won her third straight World Cup slalom crown in 2015.

Hide Caption 9 of 13 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2017 – Shiffrin was back to her best in 2017, though, winning a fifth slalom World Cup title and adding a third World Championship gold. She also won her first overall World Cup title. Hide Caption 10 of 13 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2018 – As her reputation grew, so did her popularity and all eyes were on Shiffrin to perform at the 2018 Winter Olympics. She was affected by the weather-hit schedule and despite winning gold in the giant slalom and silver in the combined she missed out completely in slalom. But she won the World Cup overall and slalom titles again at the end of the season to confirm her status as America's new superstar. Hide Caption 11 of 13 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far Shiffrin has been on fire during the 2018-19 season and has made waves beyond ski racing for her level of consistency and domination. She has climbed to fifth on the list off all-time most successful ski racers, and third woman behind Lindsey Vonn and Annemarie Moser-Proll.

Hide Caption 13 of 13

Her dominance this season has resonated way beyond skiing and drawn comparisons with greats from other sports.

The 23-year-old has won 11 of her last 14 World Cup races and 13 in all this season to climb to third on the women's all-time list of most successful ski racers with 56 victories, just six short of Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell (62) and hard on the heels of Vonn.

Shiffrin won her first ever World Cup race as a 17-year-old in Are in December 2012, and returns to the Swedish venue bidding for a fourth consecutive slalom world title.

Her main rival this season has been Slovakia's Petra Vlhova, who has pipped Shiffrin twice but otherwise ended as runner-up six other times behind the American. The pair even clocked a dual victory with a dead heat in a giant slalom in Maribor last week.

An out-of-sorts Shiffrin missed a slalom medal completely in the South Korea Olympics, but she clinched giant slalom gold and will also be overwhelming favorite in that discipline in Are.

Among the main challengers will be Vlhova, France's Tessa Worley and Italian Federica Brignone.

Magic Marcel

Marcel Hirscher is the standout male skier of his generation.

Hirscher is one of Austria's biggest stars and the pre-eminent male ski racer of his generation, and he goes to Are looking to defend his slalom and giant slalom crowns.

The 29-year-old, a six-time world champion across various disciplines, has been simply stunning in skiing's technical events over the years and is well on his way to an unprecedented eight straight World Cup overall title. He has scored 68 World Cup wins and counting and could be the one to pass Stenmark.

Like Shiffrin, his Olympic slalom ambitions crashed in Pyeongchang, but he hit back with a first ever Games gold in the giant slalom and added a win in the combined.

Hirscher and his wife Laura had a baby boy last summer, but his fire seems undimmed and he has won 10 times this season to keep the competition at arms' length.

Hirscher's long-time rival Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway has been close without really challenging this season, but rising French star Clement Noel and Swiss Daniel Yule have taken up the chase in slalom.

Frenchman Alexis Pinturault and Austrian Marco Schwarz could be the dangers in giant slalom.

Swiss Beat Feuz is the defending world champion and arguably the most likely to deprive Svindal of a fairy tale send-off in Are.

The 31-year-old bagged bronze in downhill and silver in super-G in Pyeongchang and has scored five podiums this season including a downhill victory in Beaver Creek. He was also third in Are in the World Cup finals downhill last March.

Joint winners that day were Austrian Vincent Kriechmayr , who this season took the honours on the leg-jellying Lauberhorn in Wengen, the longest and fastest track on the circuit, and former Olympic downhill champion Matthias Mayer of Austria.

Other names to watch are Italian Dominik Paris, who scorched to a third Kitzbuhel victory on the legendary Hahnekamm course in January, compatriot Christof Innerhofer and Svindal's team-mate Kjetil Jansrud.

cnn,Mikaela Shiffrin wins slalom to continue World Cup record quest,[],"(CNN) Mikaela Shiffrin maintained her dominance on Saturday with her 13th victory of the season, comfortably winning the slalom World Cup event at Maribor, Slovenia.

The 23-year-old American was leading going into her final perfectly executed run, finishing 0.77 seconds ahead of Sweden's Anna Swenn-Larsson. Wendy Holdener of Switzerland finished third.

""This year has been very special,"" Shiffrin said, barely able to catch her breath in a TV interview immediately following her winning run.

""It's always a big fight, but it's something I'm really proud of this whole season. My team has done a great job ... it's hard to put it into words.""

The win came a day after Shiffrin finished tied for first place in the giant slalom with Slovakia's Petra Vlhova.

The results earned Shiffrin a Golden Fox Trophy, awarded to the highest finisher in both technical disciplines for the tournament in Maribor.

""The first time I won the Golden Fox I thought, I'm starting to be more than just a slalom skier and that's a nice thing,"" she said.

Chasing history

The victory took Shiffrin's overall tally to 56 World Cup wins, passing Swiss great Vreni Schneider for third on the all-time list of women's World Cup winners.

Austria's Annemarie Moser Proell (62) sits in second place behind retiring American Lindsey Vonn (82).

This season, Shiffrin has become the first skier -- male or female -- to have won 16 races in a calendar year.

With her 13th victory this season, Shiffrrin is now just one short of the record of the most wins in a single season -- Schneider won an unprecedented 14 races in 1988-89.

Shiffrin is bidding for a third straight World Cup overall title and leads Vlhova by 651 points in the season standings.

She is also chasing a fourth straight slalom world title at the World Championships in Are, Sweden this month.

Vonn to retire

The World Cup event was held just a day after the retirement announcement of Vonn, one of the most decorated skiers in history.

The American star took to social media Friday with a very personal post, saying she will retire after the World Championships in Are, Sweden later this month.

Photos: Skiing's speed queen The world's greatest female ski racer Lindsey Vonn has announced her retirement plans. Here's a look at her glittering career to date. Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen She made her Olympic debut at Salt Lake City 2002 as a 17-year-old, finishing 32nd in slalom and sixth in the combined slalom/downhill event. Hide Caption 2 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Lindsey Kildow -- as she was then before marrying fellow skier Thomas Vonn -- won her first World Cup race with victory in the downhill at Lake Louise, Canada, in 2004. Hide Caption 3 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen In 2005, Vonn signed with Red Bull and began working with a completely new coaching team. She seemed set for the start of something special. Hide Caption 4 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Any momentum from the new deal was slowed during the 2006 Olympics in Italy, though. A fall in practice resulted in a short stay in hospital. She recovered in time to compete but could only manage seventh in the Super G and eighth in the downhill events. Hide Caption 5 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen However, Vonn quickly bounced back and won the first of three straight World Cup titles in 2008 at the age of 23. Hide Caption 6 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Golden girl Vonn achieved her Olympic dreams in 2010. She won the Olympic downhill gold at Whistler and added bronze in the super-G. Hide Caption 7 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Vonn added a fourth World Cup title in 2012, but is still behind Annemarie Moser-Proell's record of six overall crystal globes. Hide Caption 8 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Vonn's public profile went galactic when she dated star golfer Tiger Woods for two years between 2013 and 2015. Hide Caption 9 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen In 2013, Vonn suffered an horrific crash at the World Championships in Austria. She underwent reconstructive knee surgery and began a long road to recovery. She attempted to return a year later, only to pull out of the 2014 Olympics after aggravating the injury again. Hide Caption 10 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Injuries continued to hamper Vonn. She fractured her left knee in February 2016 in a crash during a World Cup super-G race in Soldeu, Andorra, but raced the combined event the next day before calling an end to her season. Hide Caption 11 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Vonn worked hard to get back in time to challenge for gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The American left PyeongChang with a bronze medal in the downhill but insisted she was proud to have made it through her injuries. Hide Caption 12 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen Vonn announced the current ski World Cup season would be her last. She is already the most successful woman in World Cup history with 82 victories and was chasing down Ingemar Stenmark's overall World Cup record of 86 victories in her sights. Hide Caption 13 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen However, a knee injury from a training crash in November meant she couldn't start her season until January. On her debut in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, she was still struggling with knee pain. Hide Caption 14 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen After much soul-searching Vonn announced that she will retire from skiing after competing in the World Championships in Are, Sweden in February 2019. ""My body is screaming at me to STOP and it's time for me to listen,"" she said. Hide Caption 15 of 16 Photos: Skiing's speed queen In her opening race at the World Championships, Vonn suffered a heavy crash and careered into safety netting. She was eventually able to ski to the bottom and said she would still compete in the downhill to bring the curtain down on her glittering career. Hide Caption 16 of 16

The 34-year-old has enjoyed a glittering career and compiled a remarkable 82 World Cup victories to sit second on the all-time list behind Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark.

She has bounced back from serious injury multiple times, but the knee problem that has plagued her in recent years has forced her to bring forward her planned retirement at the end of the season.

""The past two weeks have been some of the most emotionally challenging days of my life,"" Vonn wrote on Facebook

""I am struggling with the reality of what my body is telling me versus what my mind and heart believe I'm capable of. The unfortunate reality is my mind and body are not on the same page. After many sleepless nights, I have finally accepted that I cannot continue ski racing.""

She added: ""My body is broken beyond repair and it isn't letting me have the final season I dreamed of. My body is screaming at me to STOP and it's time for me to listen.""

Vonn, the 2010 Olympic downhill champion and two-time bronze medalist, will compete in the super-G on February 5 and downhill on February 10 in Sweden before exiting the sport she has graced at the top level since her debut as a 17-year-old in 2002.",https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/02/sport/skiing-world-cup-maribor-mikaela-shiffrin-spt-intl/index.html,2019-02-02 00:00:00
cnn,"Sydney Sevens: All Blacks win, USA claims fourth straight silver",['George Ramsay'],"(CNN) A new tournament, but the same result for the USA rugby sevens team, who fell to a fourth straight cup final defeat at the Sydney Sevens on Sunday.

For the second time this season, New Zealand got the better of the Eagles in a World Rugby Sevens Series gold medal encounter. The 21-5 victory for the All Blacks sees them tie with the USA at the top of the overall standings.

The wait for silverware goes on for Mike Friday's team -- which previously also fell at the final hurdle in Dubai Cape Town , and Hamilton -- after tries from Regan Ware, Sam Dickson, and Tone Ng Shiu handed the All Blacks victory with Brett Thompson producing a late reply for the USA.

""We are once again hugely disappointed with the result after a very attritional and exhausting second day where we had to scrap for everything,"" said Eagles' head coach Mike Friday.

""The final as expected was a hugely physical affair and whilst we did control the ball for good periods, unfortunately we made some errors which let the New Zealand team build scores in the first half.""

Wins over France, Kenya and rival Canada saw USA reach the knockout stages, before getting the better of Spain and England to reach Sunday's showpiece.

Defeat in the final means the Eagles once again share the spoils at the top of the overall standings, although this time with the All Blacks following Fiji's fourth-place finish in Sydney.

While agonizing, another runner-up berth ensures the USA continues its best ever start to a season. Last year saw just one podium finish -- a gold medal in Las Vegas, where the men's circuit heads next.

""We need to get some perspective as well in how well as a squad we are performing,"" said Friday.

""We are sitting top of the table going into Vegas and our aim to be in the top four at the end of the season, but we are hungry for cup wins along the way.""

The All Blacks proved themselves to be the dominant force in Sydney, and sent out a big statement with a six-try, 36-14 victory over Fiji in the semifinals. Victory over the USA was their seventh sevens title on Australian soil.

Having secured Commonwealth and World Cup gold medals in 2018, New Zealand will be keen to replicate that success in the World Series having not taken the overall title since 2014.

""I thought we played extremely well over the past two days apart from a slow start yesterday morning,"" said head coach Clark Laidlaw.

""To execute as well as we did in those last two games is really pleasing and shows the huge amount of belief this team has.""

Double delight for New Zealand

In the women's competition, there was a repeat of last year's final with Australia meeting New Zealand.

This year, however, the result was overturned with the Black Ferns defeating the home favorite 34-10, completing New Zealand's double in Sydney.

Michaela Blyde led the scoring with a second-half hat-trick in the final, along with scores from Stacey Waaka and Shakira Baker to hand the Black Ferns a comprehensive victory and a third-straight World Series title this season.

The Black Ferns perform the haka after beating Australia in New Zealand.

""It doesn't get much harder than beating Australia in Australia, and we hadn't won the Sydney event before so it's a great moment,"" said coach Allan Bunting.

""This weekend has definitely tested our depth and it has been really pleasing to see everyone step up and put in performances they can be proud of.""

Midway through the season, the result puts New Zealand in the driving seat to regain the overall title from Australia. Victories in Glendale, Dubai, and Sydney put them 12 points clear of second-place USA.

cnn,Bec Rawlings: Australia's bare-knuckle world champion,['Aimee Lewis'],"(CNN) ""He punched me, he kicked me, he elbowed me, he choked me unconscious, he smothered me with pillows, he pinned me down for hours at a time, he destroyed all my belongings, he pulled a knife on me and said he was going to kill me and the boys and then kill himself.""

Bec Rawlings, the self-styled ""Queen of bare-knuckle boxing,"" is remembering the terror of living with an abusive husband. Though the 29-year-old Australian doesn't cry anymore when talking about her miserable marriage, some wounds will never heal.

Nearly six years on, she can sleep now without fear of being murdered and no longer flinches when touched. ""It gets easier day by day,"" she says candidly. ""I'm alive, I survived.""

The former UFC fighter, a mother of two boys, a bare-knuckle world champion, is opening up because she wants to help those who may be suffering like she once did.

She wants to tell victims of abuse that they are not to blame, that they are not weak. ""I'm the definition of a powerful woman,"" she says. ""That it can happen to me means it can happen to anyone.""

Rawlings did not press charges against her now ex-husband Dan Hyatt, the father of her youngest child. Since their relationship ended, former MMA fighter Hyatt has been found guilty of physically and emotionally abusing girlfriends in subsequent relationships and Rawlings regrets not taking her case through the courts.

""I could've saved them if I went ahead and pressed charges,"" says the Tasmanian, ruefully.

""The only way I feel I can make up for that is to share my story and hope someone reads it and realizes that if it can happen to someone like me, who is so strong and looks fearless, it can happen to anyone. It doesn't mean you're weak, you're not pathetic, because that's how I felt.""

In the dead of night, with her two boys, Enson and Zake, and little else in tow, Rawlings mustered the courage to leave her husband and her home in 2013. Had it not been for her sons, she says, she would probably have stayed in a relationship which as emotionally abusive as it was physical.

""I left to save them,"" she says. ""Once he threatened to hurt them that was my switch to get out. If I never had them, I would never have made it out.""

Rawlings used to fight in the flyweight division in UFC

Rawlings met Hyatt in 2010 and within three months she says he began to belittle her, to play with her mind, the torment turning physical when Rawlings became pregnant with Enson. It was relentless. It was daily. It was hell. But crushed by his fists and by fear, she stayed.

""Looking back, I see the flags early on in our relationship,"" the boxer admits with the help of hindsight.

""He was a pro fighter himself so even when I tried to fight back I couldn't win. It was impossible for me to defend myself. He'd burn and tear my clothes. There were times that I had no clothes because he would destroy them.

""He always said he would hunt us down and hunt my family down if I ever left and that was always in the back of my head -- that he would find us and would kill us.""

Hyatt was released from prison eight months ago and in an email to CNN the Australian described his relationship with Rawlings as ""toxic"" and ""volatile"" but refuted the allegations of violence made by her and described her claims that he threatened to kill the boys as ""disgusting.""

""Bec is as much a victim of our relationship as I was myself,"" he wrote. ""That may not be a popular opinion, but its [sic] the truth and it's been my story since day one. I was a poor partner and an even poorer father, but I am certainly not the picture Bec likes to paint of me when media comes calling.""

Rawlings (R) punches Jessica-Rose Clark of Australia in their women's UFC flyweight bout in 2017

For Rawlings if any good has come from the bad it is that it was her ex-husband who introduced her to MMA, setting her on a path to UFC, bare-knuckle boxing and world domination. ""I'm happy, strong and healthy,"" she says. ""I've got a good life and he hasn't so that's the ultimate revenge, success.

""It's definitely a bitter-sweet story because I found fighting and MMA when I started seeing him, so he brought something cool into my world and, obviously, my young son Enson.

""It's definitely made me the strong person I am today. I know going into training, going into fights, no-one can hurt me as much as he could. He's definitely given me a strength I never knew I had. That's one of the positives I can take. If he couldn't break me, no-one can.

""It also taught me to love myself, to never let myself be in that position again. I put up with it and went through with it because I thought I deserved that and because I didn't love myself and I believed what he was saying.""

Rawlings punches Britain Hart during the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship 2

The Australian has come a long way since her professional debut as an MMA fighter in October 2011. Knocked out in the first round by a head kick, it was a fight which, Rawlings jokes, ""scared my mother for life."" Her mum has not attended a fight since. These days she will record a televised bout, watching her daughter only when secure in the knowledge that she is unharmed.

Standing at 1.68m (5ft 6in) and competing at a fighting weight of 57kg (125lbs), the athletic Rawlings, who once described herself as a ""wild child"" and has the moniker ""Rowdy Bec"" stitched onto her fighting shorts, isn't big in stature, but she does nevertheless stand out.

Sometimes her hair is purple, other times white and dreadlocked. There are also the tattoos. Lots of them. She has, she thinks, about 60, all inked by the tattooist who was her first sponsor.

One tattoo is a big red heart at the front of her throat, another the word ""Riot,"" her ex-husband's nickname as an MMA fighter, still visible under a red ""VOID"" stamp. Her left leg is adorned with a tattoo of a hand pistol tucked into a garter.

Some of the tattoos on Rawlings' legs

Like most who earn a living with their fists, Rawlings has swagger (""I definitely think I'm going to be dominating this sport for a long time"") but the bluster isn't relentless.

She isn't afraid to talk about her traumatic past and laughs when speaking about one particular weakness. A design on her right leg has yet to be completed because, she says giggling, she is a ""cry baby"" when it comes to getting inked.

But Rawlings can tolerate pain better than most, though the Australian stresses that the majority of her training sessions are spent mastering the art of avoiding crunching blows to the head by a clenched bare knuckle.

How does it feel to be bashed in the face by a fist flying at such a force that the eyes begin to weep and swell? Rawlings laughs.

""To be punched bare-knuckle, it doesn't feel any different to the MMA gloves,"" she explains.

""When you get punched by a big boxing glove it's more like a thud that rings your head. With MMA gloves and bare-knuckle, it's like a real sharp sting. If you've ever been hit on the nose with a basketball, it's kind of that feeling. That stingy, eye-watering feeling.

""To hit someone bare-knuckle you feel it on your hands more. You can't be throwing punches 100% and you definitely have to be careful with where you're throwing the punches.

""You don't want to be hitting people at the back of the head, or the side of the head, because you're going to do damage to your hands, so you're going to have to be precise and aim for the softer parts of the body and the face, look after your hands that way.

""You definitely throw a lot less punches and focus on speed, precision and power.""

Rawlings celebrates after defeating Britain Hart in Mississippi on August 25, 2018

Rawlings says her hands swell easily, but with the added composure that comes with experience the bumps, cuts and redness were not as significant after her second bout compared to her debut.

To strengthen her hands, she practices an ancient Kung Fu method called iron palm training, which includes punching sandbags and rubbing a special oil onto the hands to help them heal.

""Basically, you're calcifying your knuckles, so they get hardened and less prone to injury,"" she says.

Rawlings is currently training for her world title defence on February 2 in Cancun, Mexico, against Cecilia Ulloa Flores. Though only her third bare-knuckle fight, she is confident.

""I get called the bare-knuckle queen and I feel like the queen of this sport,"" she says.

""I don't think anyone's got what I have. My skill is getting better and better every fight and I'm going to go out there in February and show that I've evolved as a fighter again.""

Typically, Rawlings trains for three to four hours a day, starting with a 2-3km early morning run before returning home to feed her boys and take them school.

With the children in the classroom, she embarks on a two-hour boxing session in the gym, comprising of either sparring, bag work or pattern drills, returning home for lunch and to collect the boys from school. Mid-afternoon and there is more to be done, either improving her cardio, endurance or explosiveness.

Sometimes she will have to drag her sons, now aged eight and 10, to the gym. They have known of no other life, but occasionally they will grumble. With the boys developing their own interests, the family dynamic is slowly changing Rawlings admits, but she is adapting.

""You've got to be able to give your kids attention and love and you also need to find the time to train. That's my job. It's how I put food on the table,"" she says.

""It's stressful and hard, but it's also my motivation. They keep me hungry, they keep me motivated to do better. It's definitely a blessing in disguise.""

""I was made for this sport,"" Rawlings says of bare-knuckle boxing

After being released by UFC following four successive defeats , Rawlings was offered a contract by the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC), the first promotion to be sanctioned to hold regulated bare-knuckle events in the US since 1889.

She is earning a decent living competing in a sport she describes as the ""ultimate test on your body, heart and soul,"" and wants to create a legacy. She has, she says, found her calling.

""I love the adrenaline of it. I love the rawness of the sport,"" she says wholeheartedly.

""It's not just the physicality, it's not just the athleticism, it's your mentality and your heart to fight and keep going.

""I'm forever tested no matter how my fight goes. I learn something new about myself and I think that's what keeps me coming back for more and it's the same with training.

""I think I lost the love of it [fighting] under UFC. I let the bright lights, the stress of making weight, get to me. I started questioning myself and forgot what I was doing it for. I forgot that I loved fighting, that it made me a better person, and I forgot that.

""My coach and anyone who has seen me fight say I'm a natural. I was made for this sport and I feel like that in training and when I fight.

cnn,Rare China photos from 19th-century,['Oscar Holland'],"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Before the arrival of photography, the Western imagination of China was based on paintings, written travelogues and dispatches from a seemingly far-off land.

From the 1850s, however, a band of pioneering Western photographers sought to capture the country's landscapes, cities and people, captivating audiences back home and sparking a homegrown photography movement in the process.

Among them were the Italian Felice Beato, who arrived in China in the 1850s to document Anglo-French exploits in the Second Opium War, and Scottish photographer John Thompson, whose journey up the Min River offered people in the West a rare look into the country's remote interior.

These are just some of the figures whose work features in a 15,000-strong photo collection amassed by New York antiquarian and collector Stephan Loewentheil. His 19th-century images span street scenes, tradespeople, rural life and architecture, showing -- in unprecedented detail -- everything from blind beggars to camel caravans on the Silk Road.

A rare book dealer by trade, Loewentheil has spent the last three decades acquiring the pictures from auctions and collectors, both in and outside China. They form what he claims to be the world's largest private collection of early Chinese photography. (And given the number of artworks and artifacts lost in the country's turbulent 20th century -- during Mao's Cultural Revolution, in particular -- the claim is entirely reasonable.)

Now, he has put 120 of the prints on display in Beijing for the first time.

The exhibition's scope runs from the 1850s, the very genesis of paper photographs in China, until the 1880s. It features examples of the earliest forms of photography, such as albumen print, which uses egg whites to bind chemicals to paper, and the ""wet plate"" process, in which negatives were processed on glass plates in a portable dark room.

These technological developments heralded the birth of commercial photography in China, as they allowed images to be quickly replicated and spread for the very first time.

""People wanted to bring back great images that they could sell in other places,"" said Loewentheil. ""People who traveled there, everyone from diplomats and businessmen to missionaries, all wanted to bring home a record of this beautiful culture of China that was so unique.

""Some of them had a market back home, but immediately they found a Chinese love for photography and they developed a strong market inside the country. Chinese photographers (then) picked up on that, and served both markets.""

Chen Man: 'Tech and art must go together'

Chinese pioneers

Despite the prominent role of foreigners in early Chinese photography, the exhibition -- and Loewentheil's collection at large -- also aims to honor the achievement of the country's own practitioners.

Some purchased cameras from departing Westerners looking to sell their cumbersome equipment, while others took advantage of Chinese innovation in the field, such as mathematician Zou Boqi, who used foreign-made products to design his own glass plate camera.

Having first arrived in port cities, photography spread throughout China in the latter half of the 19th century. This led to the creation of commercial studios specializing in portraits of individuals and families, with many of the pictures later hand-colored by trained painters.

Pioneering figures, like Lai Afong, produced portraits, landscapes and cityscapes that were, in Loewentheil's eyes, equal in quality to those of their Western contemporaries.

""There is an equality in Chinese photography, and of Chinese photographers, that is not sufficiently known in China,"" the collector said. ""Some of the very earliest Chinese photographers were brilliant.""

Instead of copying their foreign forebears, China's photographers were often inspired by their own artistic traditions. Portraits, for instance, were treated more like paintings in their composition and use of light, Loewentheil said. Sitters were often pictured facing the camera, straight on and wearing little or no expression, with early portraits appearing to ""simulate painted Chinese ancestor portraits.""

Images of architecture, meanwhile, embraced the surrounding nature rather than focusing on the buildings in isolation, another divergence from the Western tradition.

""Very often, when we have an unidentified photographer, we have a pretty good idea of whether they're Chinese or Western,"" Loewentheil added.

Preservers of history

Beyond their artistic value, Loewentheil's images also appear to be of academic interest. His current exhibition is taking place at Beijing's Tsinghua University, one of China's leading colleges.

The arrival of foreign technology, including cameras, during the 19th century was just one of the radical changes that would bring the imperial era to an end (China became a republic in 1912 following a four-month revolution). As such, photos from the time capture a world that would quickly disappear from sight.

Take, for instance, the work of Englishman Thomas Child, an engineer who documented the intricacies of China's traditional architecture. His pictures of Beijing's Summer Palace, which was subsequently burned down by English and French invaders, offer an invaluable record of its lost architecture.

""Photography is the greatest preserver of history,"" Loewentheil said. ""For many years, the written word was the way that history was transmitted. But the earliest photography preserves culture in China, and elsewhere, as it had been for many hundreds of years because it was simultaneous with the technological revolutions that were to change everything.""

And while Loewentheil has made a business of collecting, he maintains that the images have been brought together for posterity's sake. He sees himself as the custodian of a historical archive -- one that should eventually return to its birthplace -- and he is currently digitizing the collection with a view to creating an online repository for historians and researchers.

""We really want this to be an asset to the Chinese people, and we're open to academics or intellectuals who want to study (the photos),"" he said.

""My hope is that the collection will end up in China. It's not for sale, but from a cultural, intellectually honest perspective: It's something that doesn't belong with me.""",https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/china-photos-19th-century-loewentheil-collection/index.html,2019-01-09 01:50:14+00:00
cnn,Can Norway win the global race to build a 'floating tunnel'?,['Andrea Lo'],"Written by Andrea Lo, CNN

With majestic glaciers, fjords and mountains, Norway is famous for its dramatic natural landscape.

Its rugged terrain does not make traveling easy, however. More than 1,000 fjords line the Scandinavian country's west coast, which is home to a third of the country's population of 5.3 million . To make the 1,100 kilometer journey between the southern city of Kristiansand and Trondheim in the north via the west coast, for example, currently takes 21 hours, and requires seven ferry crossings.

The Norwegian government plans to cut that time by half with a groundbreaking $40 billion infrastructure project to make the route ""ferry-free.""

The plan includes bridges and the world's deepest and longest rock tunnel -- drilled through bedrock under the seabed -- measuring 392 meters (1,286 feet) deep and 27 kilometers (17 miles) long.

But the most ambitious aspect is the development of submerged floating tunnels that sit around 30 meters (100 feet) under the surface of the water.

If successful, Norway could win a global race against countries including China, South Korea and Italy, which are researching similar projects

The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA), the governmental body responsible for the project, aims to complete construction by 2050.

Why build a floating tunnel?

The journey between Kristiansand and Trondheim is part of the E39, which is a ""key route for Norway,"" explains Kjersti Kvalheim Dunham, a project manager at NPRA.

Norwegian coast. More than 50% of export goods in Norway originate from this area, she adds -- yet the route ""has a very low standard for a European road."" Crossing the fjords via ferry, while a A combination of motorways, roads and ferry rides, E39 runs along the southwesternNorwegian coast. More than 50% of export goods in Norway originate from this area, she adds -- yet the route ""has a very low standard for a European road."" Crossing the fjords via ferry, while a popular transport method , can be time-consuming.

The government intends to improve transport ""for commercial purposes (and) also for the welfare of the local population,"" Dunham says.

Three suspension bridges and five floating bridges will be built. Floating bridges -- structures that are supported by pontoons -- have been built in Norway and the US, among other countries.

are not going to cut it. The seabed would be too deep to be drilled through for a rock tunnel or for a suspension bridge's foundations to be laid. When a fjord is deeper than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) or wider than 5 kilometers (3 miles) , however, existing engineering solutionsare not going to cut it. Theseabed would be too deep to be drilled through for a rock tunnel or for a suspension bridge's foundations to be laid.

Floating bridges do not work in all cases because they are susceptible to harsh weather conditions such as strong waves and currents.

This is where the floating tunnels come in.

In 1882, British naval architect Edward Reed The idea for a submerged floating tunnel is not new.In 1882, British naval architect Edward Reed proposed a floating tunnel across the English Channel -- an idea that was vetoed.

The term ""floating"" is perhaps misleading. The tunnels are fixed in position with cables -- either anchored to the seabed or tethered to pontoons which are spaced far enough apart to allow boats to pass through. Made of concrete, they would function like conventional tunnels, transporting vehicles from one end of a fjord to another.

Waves and currents at 100 feet below sea level are less powerful than those at the surface, explains NPRA's chief engineer Arianna Minoretti.

In addition, a floating tunnel minimizes the impact on the landscape since most of the infrastructure is out of sight. It also creates less noise than traffic on a bridge would. ""That would be an advantage ... (for) people living in the area,"" Minoretti says.

Ambitious project

The biggest risks in the project are explosions, fire and overloading, says Minoretti -- and so extensive testing is essential.

NPRA is working with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Center for Advanced Structural Analysis (CASA), using live explosives to ""investigate how tubular concrete structures behave when subjected to internal blast loads,"" says CASA researcher Martin Kristoffersen.

The tests will help the team to understand what would happen to the tunnel's structure if, for example, a truck carrying dangerous goods exploded inside.

Results so far indicate that the constant water pressure that surrounds the floating tunnels reduces the damage caused by explosions.

Working with the Norwegian navy, the NPRA team is also investigating how the tunnels would fare if submarines crashed into them.

While locations for the submerged floating tunnels have not yet been pinned down, Minoretti says the project will be completed in just over 30 years' time.

The improved E39 will open up more of the west coast to tourism, while the tunnels may become attractions in their own right -- especially if they are a world first.

""As a bridge engineer working on this amazing project,"" says Minoretti, ""one can only hope.""",https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/norway-underwater-floating-tunnel-intl/index.html,2019-01-29 03:32:21+00:00
cnn,Unseen photos provide a sensitive look at America's early 'working girls',['Dita Von Teese'],"Written by Dita Von Teese

Women in sexual professions have always distinguished themselves from other women, from the mores of the time, by pushing the boundaries of style. The most celebrated concubines and courtesans in history set the trends in their respective courts. The great dames of burlesque -- Sally Rand, Gypsy Rose Lee -- boasted a signature style on- and offstage, reflecting broader-than-life personalities.

Given that photography was still an emerging technology, an emerging creative medium, when these ""working girls"" posed for William Goldman in the 1890s at a Reading, Pennsylvania brothel, the entire exercise transcends their initial business liaison. The instantaneous concept of click-and-shoot was still decades away. To be photographed required sitting very still. The women featured in Goldman's collection obviously caught his eye. Not just anyone is asked to be the subject of artistic documentation.

The local photographer and his anonymous muses appear to straddle an artful titillation, at times striving toward Degas nudes and at another, more in the spirit of a strip and tease. There is a beauty in even the most mundane moments.

Among Goldman's models, my own gaze zeroed in on the striped stockings and darker shades of their risqué brassieres. These ladies of Reading, Pennsylvania, might not have had the wealth of Madame du Barry, celebrated mistress of Louis XV of France, or the fame and freedom of a silver-screen sex goddess such as Mae West. But they sought to elevate their circumstances, to feel lovelier and more fashionable, with a daring pair of knickers.

To feel special is fundamental to the human condition. Few opportunities outshine a sense of specialness than when an artist asks to record your looks, your beauty. Under the right circumstances, to be the object of admiration -- of desire -- to be what is essentially objectified is not only flattering. It can also provide a shot of confidence and a sense of strength and power and even liberation, however lasting or fleeting.

Courtesy Serge Sorokko Gallery/Glitterati Editions

For these working girls who were already going against the drudgery of toiling in a factory or as a domestic, who were surviving in a patriarchal world by their wits and sexuality, the opportunity to sit for Goldman was very likely not only thrilling. It was also empowering.

One can only imagine the mutual giddiness prevailing among them all, too, at the possible outcome from all these lost afternoon shoots. In a singular image from this collection appears Goldman striking a pose as proud as a peacock. It's one of stock masculinity in the canons of classic portraiture (though usually in military uniform), and like his muses, presented in all his naked glory. By sharing in the objectivity of the process, Goldman basks in the specialness his models must have felt. By stepping around the lens, he becomes a true confidante.

It suggests a balance of power between artist and muse, man and woman -- at least behind closed doors. Their collective decision to strip and strut for the camera reveals a shared lack of shame for the body beautiful and, in that, a shared, albeit secret, defiance of cultural mores.

By all accounts from curator Robert Flynn Johnson's devoted research on this once-lost collection, Goldman seems to have kept his treasured collection as a personal trove. As a successful photographer of weddings and social events, it was most certainly not in his interest for the public to know about his private creative pursuits.

The brothel was a necessary evil in town, where men with certain desires visited women who would oblige. In this case, it was the desire of a man to capture the beauty and sensuality of the women he befriended. There is much to learn and (most of all!) take pleasure in with this discovery.

As these lost photographs illustrate more than a century later, one period's ""social problem"" is another's cultural revelation.",https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/working-girls-william-goldman/index.html,2018-11-29 11:40:41+00:00
cnn,How the Soviet Concorde crashed and burned,[],"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

When the Soviet rival to the Concorde made its first foreign appearance at the Paris Air Show in 1971, everyone was impressed. In the heated race to develop a supersonic passenger jet, it was the USSR who got off to a head start.

French President Georges Pompidou, foregoing nationalism, called it ""a beautiful plane."" The makers of the Concorde itself conceded that it was ""quieter and cleaner.""

The Tupolev Tu-144 looked very similar to its Anglo-French competitor -- which inevitably earned it the nickname ""Concordski"" -- but it was somewhat more exotic and mysterious. And the Soviets' track record in aerospace demanded respect: that same year, they had achieved the first probe-landing on Mars and launched the first space station. They seemed perfectly positioned to beat the West on supersonic passenger travel.

Instead, through a mix of shortcomings and bad luck, the Concordski would soon turn into one of civil aviation's biggest failures.

The race for supersonic flight

Although it's the Concorde that earned a place in history, the lesser known Tu-144 beat it to the skies twice: it had its maiden flight on Dec. 31, 1968 -- two months before the Concorde -- and then achieved its first supersonic flight in June 1969, beating the competition by four months.

These were no small victories. The Americans were out of the supersonic race (Congress had canceled funding to a similar Boeing project in 1971), but the program was still a badge of honor for the Soviet Union.

Every effort was made to outshine the Concorde: ""Development started in the midst of a rivalry between two political systems,"" Ilya Grinberg, a Soviet aviation expert and engineering professor at Buffalo State University, said in an email. ""Expectations were high. The entire USSR was extremely proud of the Tu-144, and the Soviet people had no doubt that it was better than Concorde. And it was so pretty!""

Both planes were clearly ahead of their time, as civil aviation had barely just transitioned from props to jets. But their striking similarities have long fueled spy stories: ""The design of the Tupolev was not a result of espionage. Although they look alike, they are rather different planes with many different aspects. External similarities are based on functional criteria and required parameters. But it is certainly possible that familiarity with the outlines of Concorde could have influenced some conceptual decisions,"" said Grinberg.

The Tupolev was slightly bigger and faster than the Concorde, but its most distinctive feature was a pair of ""canards"" or winglets right behind the cockpit, which provided extra lift and improved handling at low speeds.

A crash over Paris

After stealing the show at the biggest event in the aviation industry in 1971, the Tu-144 did it again in 1973, but due to tragedy rather than triumph.

The rivals were once again squaring off. The Concorde completed its demonstration first, without a hitch, but the Tupolev put on a far more audacious show, with twists and turns that proved to be fatal: the aircraft broke up in midair and crashed into the village of Goussainville, killing six on board and eight on the ground.

An outlandish conspiracy theory claims the Tupolev crashed to avoid collision with a french Mirage fighter that was trying to photograph it , but Grinberg is quick to dismiss it: ""The Mirage had nothing to do with that crash. It was just speculation to divert attention from the real cause, which was drastic maneuvering of the Tu-144 that exceeded allowable stress limits.""

Footage of the crash shows the Tupolev going into a nosedive, presumably to reignite the engines after they had flamed out. Under too much pressure, the wings broke off.

""The pilots attempted to impress the public and the world's press, to show that the Soviet plane could be 'sexier' than the more conservative display of the Concorde. That's quite clear from the footage.""

55 flights

That was the start of a downward spiral from which the Tu-144 never recovered. The Paris crash delayed the Soviet program by four years, allowing the Concorde to enter service first. But it didn't entirely convince the Soviets that the plane needed more testing.

""Political priorities to overcome the West, no matter what, obviously played a negative role, as they favored rushing over proper scheduling in a highly challenging and complicated field,"" said Grinberg.

When it finally started flying passengers in 1977, the Tu-144 turned out to be cramped, prone to breaking and unbearably noisy because -- unlike the Concorde -- it could only sustain supersonic speeds using afterburners, like military aircraft: ""A flight on the Tu-144 was not for those with sensitive hearing"" Jonathan Glancey wrote in his book "" Concorde .""

Aeroflot used the Tu-144 to serve the rather obscure two-hour route between Moscow and Alma Ata (now Almaty), then capital of Kazakhstan, chosen because it passed over sparsely populated areas. But the weekly flights were mostly half-empty and the plane ended up transporting more cargo and mail than people. The service was canceled after six months.

In its short life as a passenger plane -- only 55 return flights -- the Tu-144 suffered hundreds of failures, many of them inflight, ranging from depressurization to engine failure to blaring alarms that couldn't be switched off. All sorts of stories have surfaced over the years about the plane's woes, including reports that passengers had to communicate through written notes because of the deafening noise. Perhaps more tellingly, each flight from Moscow could only depart after the aircraft had been personally inspected by the plane's designer, Alexei Tupolev himself.

""The country as a whole was not ready to deploy planes like this. It had teething problems, it was not economical, and ultimately there was no real need for high-speed passenger transportation,"" said Grinberg.

The end of an era

The Tu-144 was already on its way out when another fatal crash happened. On May 23, 1978, one caught fire near Moscow and made an emergency landing during which two flight engineers were killed. Although the accident prompted a complete ban on passenger flights, the real reason for the plane's demise lay elsewhere.

""It was loss of interest in the program by the Soviet leadership as well as Aeroflot top brass. They've had enough of the headaches associated with this highly complex program. There were no real economic incentives to use it in the Soviet domestic markets,"" said Grinberg.

Over the next few years, without much fanfare, the plane was quietly retired and production of new aircraft was stopped. The program was finally grounded in 1984. In total, just 17 Tu-144s were produced, including prototypes. Most were scrapped , but a few are on display in aviation museums in Russia and Germany.

The very last flight of the Tu-144 happened in 1999, thanks to NASA, which sponsored a three-year joint US-Russian research program on supersonic flight. The aircraft used was the last Tu-144 ever built, which had logged just 82 flight hours. It was flown 27 times near Moscow before the program was canned due to lack of funds.

Tupolev briefly tinkered with the idea of a successor, called Tu-244 , but never actually built one. The Concorde itself last flew in 2003, but it was doomed since its only fatal accident in 2000 , which killed 113 near Paris -- not far from where the first Tu-144 crashed in 1973.

Many other supersonic planes have been proposed since, but none have made it to production. ""I do not foresee one anytime soon. In the age of Internet and real-time video conferences there is no need for high-speed transportation for business purposes,"" said Grinberg.

""It is a pity that the Tu-144 and the Concorde have left the skies. Despite economic constraints and notwithstanding basic necessities, people need a dream, such as traveling at supersonic speed in comfort. Not the worst dream to have, I suppose.""",https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tupolev-tu-144-concordski/index.html,2017-09-28 11:32:36+00:00
cnn,Amalia Ulman's Instagram art and selfie culture,['Alicia Eler'],"Written by Alicia Eler, CNN

Argentinian-born artist Amalia Ulman's ""Excellences and Perfections"" performance happened only four years ago, but in the digital age, it feels like much longer.

On the surface, the project seemed relatively simple: On Instagram , Ulman, now 29, spun a pastel-pink narrative of herself as an optimistic young woman pursuing her dreams in Los Angeles. Things started innocuously enough (""another sunny day in LA aaaaahhhh i lov my life,"" reads an early caption), but after she broke up with her boyfriend (""dont be sad because it's over, smile because it happened""), things took a turn. She chronicled her post-breakup breakdown -- sexy mirror selfies, escorting, implied breast augmentation, tearful videos -- and her eventual recovery through yoga, meditation and avocado toast. Amid selfies and inspirational text posts, there were photos of berry bowls and flowers in bloom.

""I like photography, performance art through photographs, and I think that was important for me to take into account,"" she said over the phone from Los Angeles, reflecting on her creative choices. ""Instagram is a lot of text and photographs, and that's kind of how I work, through photography. Snapchat is too much about just the action, and I am more interested in the aesthetics of the images.""

Ulman's Instagram account gained thousands of new followers who watched her seemingly personal journey. And then, five months in, when she hit about 90,000 followers, she revealed that it was all a performance. She'd cast herself as a semi-fictional character based on popular images that certain girls (affluent, young, often white) post of themselves on Instagram. In doing so, she revealed how emotions and experiences can be staged on social media, often for attention, or out of loneliness, or just wanting to have others bear witness to one's personhood.

While the performance would win Ulman acclaim in the art press, it received backlash from followers who had become invested in her character's narrative and felt they'd been deceived. But that was precisely the point of her project: to unpack the performativity of social media itself.

Shortly after the project was completed, it was archived by the digital art site Rhizome, and in 2016, images from ""Excellences & Perfections"" were included in Tate Modern's ""Performing for the Camera"" group show, alongside work by Cindy Sherman and Yayoi Kusama. And now, four years later, it's been transformed into a new book . Published by Prestel, it includes the Instagram posts used in the project, along with essays by the influential German artist Hito Steyerl, gallerist Rózsa Farkas, novelist Natasha Stagg, and editor Rob Horning.

Where fiction meets reality

Nowadays, Ulman is focused on other projects. She recently exhibited a film at the Armory art fair in New York, and when we spoke in mid-March, she was preparing to fly to Beijing for her first solo show in China . She's also working on the book about a second online performance. But the book has given her reason -- and time -- to reflect on ""Excellences & Performances"" anew.

""It couldn't be done now,"" Ulman said. ""It was very specific to its time.""

Indeed, in 2014, Instagram was still relatively new. It was founded in 2010, but had only been acquired by Facebook in 2012. Ads and direct messages were still new developments, and Stories were still years away. But most importantly, Ulman feels Instagram had not yet turned into a de facto branding platform for the average person.

""Now the problem is that everyone is required to be a celebrity,"" she said. ""(Before) only people in the arts or entertainment industry were required to have to deal with certain things, and now it's required of everyone to learn these skills of (being) a minor celebrity -- the way they look, the way they are perceived -- which is kind of dangerous.""

On the last 10 pages of the book, Ulman includes captions and comments from the Instagram pics. In the comments we see a mix of people from the internet, including random strangers and fellow internet artist Ryder Ripps. Ulman replies to some of them.

On a photo of Chanel bath products , @xoangrybb (now @katya_vesely) wrote, ""allergic reactions written all over dat for me,"" sparking a brief conversation about products. The exchange feels authentic, and once again calls to question what is real on social media, and what is merely part of the performance. But Ulman is happy to let the viewer draw their own conclusions.

""Once it goes online, it goes online, but it's true that it's not me anymore. It's just this thing that keeps on growing,"" she said. ""It's just this copy that keeps on growing and acquiring new meanings.""",https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/amalia-ulman-instagram-excellences-perfections/index.html,2018-03-29 10:26:16+00:00

cnn,"Italian town will pay you $10,000 to move in",[],"(CNN) — Tempted by the recent offer of an Italian home for just over a $1 ? Well, you might want to hold out for a better deal.

Now one town in the country is offering foreigners $10,000 to move there. Another says it will even pay newcomers more than $1,000 per child to make babies.

The deals may seem too good to be true for many who dream of escaping the rat race for the idyll of a rustic Italian village. For the destinations involved, they represent a last-ditch battle to save the souls of their dying communities.

But it's complicated -- this is a country where local property regulations are often tangled up in byzantine legalities.

And, of course, it's a place where attitudes towards foreign incomers are sometimes ambivalent, as highlighted by a recent rise in political hostility towards economic migrants arriving from Africa and the Middle East.

The latest deal to beat them all comes from Giovanni Bruno Mattiet, the mayor of the tiny Alpine village of Locana, in Piedmont, the mountainous northwestern region of Italy that borders France and Switzerland.

He's willing to pay up to €9,000, or $10,200, over three years to families willing to move in and take up residency amid snowy peaks and flower-strewn pastures, as long as they have a child and a minimum annual salary of €6,000.

""Our population has shrunk from 7,000 residents in the early 1900s to barely 1,500 as people left looking for a job at Turin's big factories,"" Mattiet tells CNN Travel. ""Our school each year faces the risk of shutting down due to few pupils. I can't allow this to happen.""

Ghost towns

l e v a r t

In Locana each year there are 40 deaths versus just 10 births. It's a familiar picture across Italy where, in the last 30 years, one in four small communities have become ghost towns . There are now 139 villages with fewer than 150 residents.

And while Mattiet's deal was initially offered just to Italians or foreigners already living in Italy, he's now so desperate to save his town from dying, he's extending it to non-Italians abroad too.

""We're looking to draw mostly young people and professionals who work remotely or are willing to start an activity here,"" he says. ""There are dozens of closed shops, bars, restaurants and boutiques just waiting for new people to run them.""

The town may be small but it's wealthy, thanks to the clean hydroelectric energy it sells to Italy's state.

With the money comes a great location. Locana's territory spreads across 132 square kilometers of the Gran Paradiso mountain reserve, offering fresh air and outdoor activities like ice-skating fishing, trekking, rock climbing, swimming, soccer and tennis.

Picturesque Alpine dwellings are made of stone and wood with typical pointed tile roofs and frescoed walls adorned with flowers. Old bridges cross clear streams.

The valleys are dotted with chestnut forests, solitary chapels, abandoned lodges, dairy farms, mills and copper mines in need of a restyle. Two minuscule ghost hamlets are accessible by foot only on mule paths covered by overgrown cherry shrubs.

""Locana offers a healthy lifestyle, great food and folklore fairs all-year round"", says Mattiet.

Baby bonus

Locana isn't the only town in Piedmont badly in need of a rebirth. A little farther north, on the Swiss frontier, the mayor of Borgomezzavalle is playing what he hopes will be a winning card.

To revitalize a population that's dwindled to barely 320 residents, Alberto Preioni is not only selling abandoned mountain cottages for just €1 -- just over $1 -- he's also paying all newcomers who are starting a family.

""This town was created in 2016 with the fusion of two neighboring villages which were disappearing,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""We've got tons of money to invest but we need kids and youth.

""That's why I'm offering €1,000 for each newborn and another €2,000 to anyone willing to start a business and register for VAT.""

Local taxes are very low and Preioni also promises free public transport to all students. There's not even any need to take up residency.

Borgomezzavalle -- the name means ""the town between the valley"" -- is stuck inside a canyon, but there's sunlight all day thanks to a huge mirror placed on the opposite hillside that reflects the rays.

Brightly colored houses with thatched roofs, carved from the mountain flank, are clustered around neat cobbled piazzas with wooden benches and flower pots.

Narrow winding alleys lead to frescoed arcaded porches with decorated columns and lavish palazzos featuring loggias.

The €1 buildings on sale include crumbling wood and stone cottages, barns, stables and former farm and artisan dwellings. The only catch is that the new owners must commit to refurbishing the houses within two years.

""I invite anyone interested to come see what a peaceful place this is, our untouched nature offers a detox and unplugged stay far from the madding crowd"", says Preioni, who's also recovering abandoned agricultural lands for use by would-be farmers.

Borgomezzavalle lies close to Italy's border with Switzerland. Roberto Bianchetti/Comune Borgomezzavalle

Borgomezzavalle and Locana are just the latest in a series of towns in Italy offering cheap, dilapidated properties to foreigners or paying them to move there (and take note, it's intended to be a permanent move, not just the offer of a cheap vacation home).

Extremely low taxes, great life quality, cheap services and rentals have successfully turned many dying spots into havens for foreign retirees.

In the Sicilian towns of Partanna, Caltabellotta, Giuliana, Siculiana and Cianciana renting a 50-square-meter apartment costs just €150 per month, while breakfast at the bar with local pastry specialties is €2.

Is it working?

If this all sounds too good to be true -- well it is and it isn't.

Andrea Ungari, contemporary history professor at Rome's top LUISS University , says shoring up communities with an influx of foreigners will fail to address the issues that caused people to desert the towns in the first place.

""It's OK in the short run, foreigners love Italy's beauty and crave for an eternal holiday in a sunny spot,"" he says. ""But in the long run, even they need upgraded infrastructures, good and nearby hospitals, efficient services, especially retirees.

""You need a long-term plan to develop the local territory and keep people there.""

One solution might be to populate the dying towns with the migrants who flock to Italy on boats across the Mediterranean, fleeing peril or hardship in Africa or the Middle East. Indeed some have moved into places like Riace, in the southwest Calabria region or Val Camonica in northern Lombardy.

It's a strategy unlikely to gain traction in Italy's current political climate though. The country's new coalition government, particularly the populist League party of Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, has spoken out against hosting migrants in Italian villages.

In two shrinking towns first reported by CNN -- Ollolai and Candela -- the deals aimed at attracting more economically attractive foreigners seem to be working out well.

Candela, in southern Puglia, offered people up to €2,000 to move there plus tax credits. It now boasts a dozen new residents of all ages, nationalities and professions, says former mayor Nicola Gatta.

In just over a year Ollolai, on the island of Sardinia, has sold several dozen €1 houses that have already been refurbished. Six are currently being restyled while another 20 will soon be handed over to new owners.

Foreign newcomers are mostly young professionals who work remotely or retirees, but there are also Italians who have returned to their hometowns.

""We weren't expecting such a success, with people coming from Europe, the US, Brazil and Australia as our new next door neighbors"", says Ollolai's deputy mayor Michele Cadeddu.

Fashion designer Marije Graafsma, who sold her home in the most northerly part of the Netherlands to relocate to Ollolai together with her partner, is enthusiastic about the move.

""It's great, I'm so happy,"" she says. ""We're almost done restyling our lovely house with a fantastic view of Sardinia's wilderness. We can't wait to settle in for good.

""In Holland people are always on the run, they don't talk much. Here they're welcoming, very friendly, you get offered coffee and treats. We feel part of a big family.""

Red tape

Graafsma has spent €75,000 on rehabilitating her attractive new dwelling. It's a good price compared to average property costs in Italy.

She says she didn't mind having to deal with a bit of red tape given she was ""prepared for it"" and the local mayor's office helped with the paperwork.

Bureaucracy can be hell in Italy -- but some say it's worth it.

In the Sicilian town of Gangi, where 200 crumbling €1 euro dwellings have been sold mainly to European professionals and artists, it took Danish computer science engineer Torkel Jensen almost two years to jump through all the necessary administrative hoops.

""That's OK, I knew what I was in for,"" he says. ""But finally, now, this lovely house, 150 square meters, is our new home. I used to live between Sweden and Denmark, so cold and dark, we wanted a sunny place"", he says.

""Here it's gorgeous and warm, people are so nice and open. My wife and I will be spending six months a year, hopefully more. I've retired but keep working remotely"".

Jensen has spent about €100,000 on an elegant renovation. While basic building materials are cheap, specific items can be more expensive. ""Still a great deal, though,"" he adds.

But, says Jensen, there's another issue to consider for families.

""These towns are great for retirees and couples without kids. For children it's not so great if you plan to live here all year-round.""

Empty gimmicks

The lunar-esque landscape has been used by NASA for testing martian rovers, while its smooth sandy dunes draw surfers looking for a different kind of wave. By night, the sky is a kaleidoscopic wonder of constellations and attracts many a stargazer.

Driving through the desert can be disorienting, and, at first, weary travelers may mistake its most unusual monument for a mirage.

It rears up from the ground as if a giant is drowning in quicksand, reaching an outstretched hand in a desperate last plea for help.

But on closer inspection, visitors will see that the ""Mano del Desierto"" -- ""Hand of the Desert"" -- is, in fact, very real.

The thumb and four fingers are an abrupt vertical interruption in the desert, a striking anomaly in the vast, otherwise uninterrupted flat swathes of sand.

Impressive dimensions

The larger-than-life hand towers an impressive 36 feet (11 meters). It's taller than an NFL goal post and nearly as high as a yellow school bus is long. The nearest city of Antofagasta, still some 46-odd miles away, lays claim to the imposing structure.

Chilean sculptor Mario Irarrázabal was asked by the townspeople to create a monument for the vast region of Atacama. And so he created the ""Hand of the Desert,"" protruding starkly from the sand and reaching for the brilliant blue sky.

Financed by local organization Corporación Pro Antofagasta, the hand was constructed in 1992, from concrete and iron.

The meanings of the monument are unknown. Some say it is meant to be a reminder that humans should be humbled by nature and the elements. Others are convinced it is a display of humans rising against the odds.

Mario Irarrázabal studied in the US, where he lived for five years, as well as in Italy and Germany. He returned to Chile in the late 1960s to dedicate his life to sculpting, and rejected a life in the clergy (his father was a church official, and he spent many years studying in church schools). He has won numerous awards for his striking work.

Unfortunately, despite numerous signs urging tourists to refrain from defacing the monument, locals rally twice yearly to clean the sculpture, which is regularly covered in profanity-ridden graffiti.

The hand may strike a solitary figure in the desert, but actually it's part of a pair.

It's right counterpart sits in Uruguay. Built a decade earlier, in Punta del Este near the Atlantic Sea, an identical four fingers and thumb stretch for the skies, this time rising from the beach.

Getting there

To get to the sculpture from Antofagasta, take Route 26 or 28, and drive until the road joins Route 5. The hand sits between mile 1309 and 1310, which are handily marked by the roadside.

Once you hit a road sign reading ""Escultura,"" there will be a path off to the right, which is the track to head down to encounter the hand.

The attraction has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more tour guides include the hand on their clients' itineraries.

cnn,CNN Travel's 19 places to visit in 2019,[],"(CNN) — Whether you want to rest on a beach in the Caribbean, hike the world's most famous canyon, explore ancient ruins, eat world-famous cuisine or learn more at historically significant sites this year, CNN Travel has the right spot for you.

Several of our 19 places to visit in 2019 are bouncing back after natural disasters that hit their economies hard. You can do some good while enjoying the beach in Hawaii, Kerala or St. Barts.

Or you can mark the 50th anniversary of man's first walk on the moon, the 100th anniversary of Grand Canyon National Park, Liechtenstein's tricentennial and importantly, Ghana's Year of Return marks 400 years since enslaved Africans arrived in North America.

Whether you want to relax, explore or learn -- or all three -- there's a destination on this list for you. Here they are in alphabetical order:

Christchurch, New Zealand

l e v a r t

Many people only associate with Christchurch with its most tragic event -- the 2011 earthquake that leveled much of the city and resulted in 185 deaths. But it isn't the natural disaster that defines a city -- it's the way they choose to regroup and rebuild.

Several years later, Christchurch has been reconstructed to be respectful of locals and to be more thoughtful of the environment, creating a city that feels at once hopeful and dynamic. Vendors who once sold out of a pop-up mall of containers are now moving to brick-and-mortar locations, followed by loyal locals. Colorful street art about hope and resilience has appeared all over the city. Music performances are often held in rotating venues around the city instead of a single opera house or concert hall so more people have a chance to attend.

The elegant Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial pays homage to those who were lost, while the Transitional Cathedral -- intended to be, by its name, temporary refuge made of cardboard for locals to go following the quake -- has become a permanent part of the cityscape.

Egypt

The land of the Pharaohs has been welcoming tourists for so long, it's a wonder that archeologists haven't discovered hieroglyphics depicting backpackers.

Sadly, the country's tourist trade has taken a battering in recent times with security concerns and political upheaval keeping many visitors away. A December 28, 2018 attack that killed four people near the Pyramids of Giza shows that there are still serious security issues.

While that may deter some, others will continue returning to a country that appears to be taking faltering steps back on to the mainstream tourism circuit.

So what's different in 2019? Well, while the sand has been settling on deserted classic monuments, Egyptologists have been brushing it gently aside elsewhere to discover a litany of exciting finds, many of which are now being opened to the public

Mummies, sphinxes, tombs and fresh pyramid mysteries have all been unearthed over the past year, as Egypt proves time and again it has many more secrets yet to be revealed.

And while safety concerns persist, hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Pyramids of Giza, the Great Sphinx, the Valley of the Kings take place without incident each year. Likewise, Egypt's main Red Sea resorts are considered safe.

Expect a major tourism drive by Egypt in coming months as it gears up to 2020's expected opening of its highly anticipated Grand Egyptian Museum . Until then, there's a perfect opportunity to beat the crowds.

Fukuoka, Japan

Fascinating history. Incredible eats. Natural beauty. If the Japanese seaside city of Fukuoka isn't already on your radar, it's time to recalibrate your Japan travel plans.

Capital of the prefecture of the same name and one of several host cities for the 2019 Rugby World Cup , Fukuoka is the gateway to the island of Kyushu.

It's the perfect destination for those looking to go beyond the well-trodden destinations like Osaka, Tokyo and Kyoto and see a new corner of Japan.

Highlights of this city and its surrounding area include the ruins of the 17th-century Fukuoka Castle, the beautiful Kyushu National Museum and Dazaifu Tenmangu , a Shinto shrine that's home to over 6,000 plum trees that blossom in stunning fashion each spring.

And while we're on the subject of blooms, another famed destination is the tunnel of wisterias at Kawachi Fuji-en Garden in Kitakyushu, about an hour's drive from the city. Another worthy day trip is Yanagawa, an hour outside of the Fukuoka, famed for its picturesque canals.

But we've saved the best for last: The food.

Due to its seaside position on Japan's east coast, Fukuoka is a seafood lover's dream destination and considered one of Japan's top foodie cities. Just head for the Nagahama Fish Market . The commercial market floor only opens to the public once a month but you can still visit its restaurants, which are open seven days a week.

We do recommend saving space for a bowl of Hakata ramen though. A local specialty, it's the original tonkotsu ramen and prized for its deliciously fatty pork broth. Try it at Ichiran , a restaurant chain found throughout Japan that originated in Hakata, Fukuoka.

Don't miss: The impressive

Ghana

West Africa's poster nation for economic success and political stability is hoping to trade up its tourism status for 2019, with a campaign targeting the African diaspora whose ancestors were victims of the brutal slave trade of centuries gone by.

The country's Year of Return marks 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in North America. It's a somber recognition of the evil that befell Ghana's past inhabitants and their descendants — and the strength with which they've faced it.

Legacies of the slave trade are unavoidable. Cape Coast Castle, one of many historic coastal forts, was where slaves were held before being dispatched to America and the Caribbean. This brutal and fascinating reminder was visited by the Obamas in 2009 and Melania Trump in 2018.

For all the sobriety of this anniversary, what also awaits visitors to Ghana is the warm, intoxicating embrace of country completely at ease with its identity rushing headlong toward a bright future.

The capital, Accra, crackles with the dynamism of a city on the upswing, with a nightlife scene to match. For those wanting to escape its relentless excitement, Ghana's 335-mile coastline boasts empty surfing spots like Cape Three Points, while its many protected wildlife zones, including Mole National Park, are home to wild elephants, Nolan warthogs and spotted hyenas.

Grand Canyon, United States

One of the world's most magnificent natural wonders and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Grand Canyon National Park is marking its centennial anniversary in 2019.

Never mind that the canyon is actually about five or six million years old, give or take a few years, with rocks at the canyon bottom dating back some 2,000 million years.

There are human artifacts dating back nearly 12,000 years to the Paleo-Indian period, and the area has been continuously occupied up to the present day.

It was first protected by the US government in 1893, and it became Grand Canyon National Park on February 26, 1919, offering the 1.2 million-acre park the most US government protection possible.

About 277 miles long and a mile deep from rim to river at various points, the park attracted more than 6 million visitors for the first time ever in 2017.

Yet most people view the Grand Canyon by the magnificent South Rim, while some visit the North Rim in season (it closes for the winter).

More adventurous sorts can take two days to hike to the canyon bottom. (Riding a mule is an easier option.) Hikers who trek from rim to rim could take three days one-way, while rafters might take two weeks or more.

Hawaii Island, United States

After a few shaky months, Hawaii Island is back, warmly welcoming visitors to its slice of paradise.

Following the devastating volcanic eruption of Kilauea in May 2018 that impacted air quality, destroyed homes and put a damper on tourism, the island of Hawaii (locals ask that you not call it ""the Big Island"") is once again primed to show off its magnificent beauty, astonishingly diverse landscape and relaxed island pace.

Although two-thirds of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed during the Kilauea eruption, much of it reopened in late September, and trails and attractions continue to attract visitors.

Volcano House , located in the park, reopened in early November and boasts top-notch star-gazing along with unparalleled volcano views.

While there are still some closures on the island and within the park, the number of new offerings is impressive enough to please even the most ambitious travelers.

Opening soon is Binchotan Bar & Grill at Fairmont Orchid -- think locally sourced seafood and local produce grilled over binchotan or white charcoal.

For locally-inspired brews, head to Ola Brew Co . Go for the Kona Gold Pineapple Cider or the Watermelon Double IPA, and stay to soak up the community vibe.

Resort aficionados, who long for breathtaking sunsets over the water, may wish to stay at the recently renovated Mauna Lani Auberge Resorts Collection, while boutique hotel seekers looking for something a little more rustic and down-to-earth can't go wrong at the Kamuela Inn , located in Waimea, an area of the island known for its ranching history.

The Hebrides, Scotland, UK

You might have heard stories about Scotland's fine white sand dunes, turquoise waters, rugged mountains, crumbling castles -- but nothing can prepare you for seeing the Hebridean islands

The most famous of the lot, the Isle of Skye, makes it onto many travelers' must-see lists, but the lesser-visited Lewis and Harris, the most northerly Outer Hebridean Island, also deserves to be there.

The birthplace of Harris Tweed, the famous cloth that's been woven, dyed and spun by the islanders for centuries, is also home to its own Stonehenge-style mystery in the Callanish Standing Stones.

Unlike Stonehenge, visitors can get up close to the standing circle of boulders at Callanish, which is believed to have been erected about 5,000 years ago.

For this and Lewis and Harris' other wonders, it's worth the drive to Ullapool, close to the northern tip of the Scottish mainland, and the 2.5-hour ferry across a choppy stretch of the Atlantic to explore these islands. Alternatively, there's the plane from Glasgow straight to Stornoway, the island's capital.

Each Hebridean island has its own distinctive vibe, but they're all grounded in a similar small-town community spirit. Islay, the southernmost Hebridean isle, known for its whisky distilleries and incredible beaches, offers a true sense of island life. Driving around, visitors might be more likely to encounter cows than people, but any meeting with an islander will likely earn an ""Islay wave"" -- a friendly acknowledgment from a fellow driver.

Jaffa, Israel

Tel Aviv-Yafo is often lumped together as one unit for the convenience of an airport and Google Maps, but 4,000-year-old Yafo (often spelled Jaffa in English) is as different from Tel Aviv as Brooklyn is from Manhattan.

The artsier sister, Jaffa has traditionally been home to narrow streets packed with jewelers, sculptors, antique dealers, candlemakers, painters and more displaying and selling their work. Also making the case for Jaffa as much more than a day trip are the three boutique hotels that opened in 2018 -- The Jaffa The Setai and The Drisco.

How to spend a perfect day there? Have hummus and pita at the jam-packed communal tables at Abu Hassan followed by sweets at Abulafia bakery. Experience the world's first deaf-blind theater company, Nalaga'at (there's a cafe next door where all the baristas are deaf and you can learn Israeli Sign Language signs for words like ""coffee""), and don't forget to pick up banana-scented soaps and orange-blossom perfume from Zielinski & Rosen.

This area of India has it all: sun, sea, sand, good food, houseboats, culture and wildlife. Its spectacular natural landscapes -- think palm trees and sprawling backwaters -- lend the region the nickname ""God's Own Country.""

Severe floods during the summer of 2018 wreaked havoc across this southwestern state, but many of its top tourist destinations escaped unscathed.

Visitors will likely land at Kochi International, an airport powered entirely by solar panels. The ancient port city of Kochi, once occupied by the Portuguese, is a multicultural hub offering plenty to do and see. It's a great place to check out traditional Kathakali dance, the storytelling dance form known for its colorful and intricate costumes and masks that hails from Kerala.

Kerala is also great for beaches, particularly in the southern part of the state. Postcard-perfect Kovalam is a surfing hotspot, while Varkala is good for just relaxing.

Kerala's backwaters are famous for a reason: a nexus of waterways linking the regions' villages and best explored via kettuvallam -- a traditional wooden houseboat. It's worth spending anywhere from a single afternoon to a week on one of the many rental houseboats on offer, enjoying the sights and sounds drifting by.

Other top trips include Munnar to see the tea plantations, and Periyar National Park, a wildlife haven offering guided jungle treks.

Liechtenstein

The world's sixth smallest country packs a lot within its borders.

Tucked between Austria and Switzerland, the tiny principality of Liechtenstein covers just 160 square kilometers (62 square miles).

Yet castles, museums and spectacular hiking and biking trails are all draws in this sliver of alpine terrain that's also a banking powerhouse for uber-wealthy international clients.

Liechtenstein has gone unnoticed by most of the world's tourists during the principality's 300 years, but the 2019 tricentennial puts the country -- with its 37,000 residents -- in the spotlight.

Ceremonies, exhibitions and celebrations are planned throughout the year to mark Liechtenstein's 300th anniversary as a principality.

In May, the Liechtenstein Trail i s set to debut. The 75-kilometer (47-mile) trail stiches together a network of existing paths that traverse all 11 municipalities. A new app -- complete with Augmented Reality -- will help visitors navigate the route.

Hikers looking for a thrill beyond the postcard-perfect landscapes can join a falconer and a golden eagle on a soaring 90-minute hiking adventure near Malbun.

Liechtenstein's capital, Vaduz, is home to a handful of museums featuring fine art, cultural artifacts, postage stamps and more. The principality's Treasure Chamber features valuable items belonging to the Princes of Liechtenstein.

Like all the world's great cities, New York ebbs and flows in a constant state of change and progress, but it's always a destination worth visiting. So why now?

In June 2019, New York will host World Pride , the world's biggest LGBTQ celebration, and simultaneously honor its own history with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.

The riots took place at an iconic Greenwich Village gay bar -- now part of a federally recognized National Monument where queer and trans individuals in the community pushed back against a police raid.

The event marked a major moment for the advancement and recognition of LGBTQ rights in the United States, and its half-century mark is a reminder that New York will always be a home to those in need -- as long as you don't try to push your way onto the subway before everyone else has gotten off.

Beyond the special celebrations, there's a reason New York's classics are classics, from the Jackson Pollocks on display at the Met to a plate full of seafood at the 42nd Street Oyster Bar inside the architectural wonder that is Grand Central Terminal.

Idyllic Normandy on France's northern coast has a big historical footprint for a long time. It's the place from which a conqueror named William set sail to tame England nearly 1,000 years ago.

But in 2019, our focus will be on the 75th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, 1944, the course of world history was altered because of the World War II English Channel crossing that launched the Allies' bloody liberation of France from Nazi rule.

There are more than 20 cemeteries in Normandy honoring war dead from Allied and Axis countries. The American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer , on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, is seen in the opening and closing scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and is a moving experience.

The Utah Landing Beach Museum , where you can see an original B-26 bomber, is one of several you can visit to learn more about the perilous effort. The Musée du Débarquement in the lovely village of Arromanches-les-Bains is another choice.

Bayeux is an excellent staging place for a vistor's tour of Normandy. While it's most known for the Bayeux Tapestry depicting the 1066 Norman invasion, it's also another excellent stop on your D-Day tour.

Oaxaca, in central Mexico, may not have gotten as much attention as Mexico City or Tulum, but it doesn't need to try hard to impress visitors, whether through its cuisine, art, ruins or mezcal.

This Mexican city, with its colorful colonial buildings and open-air marketplaces selling a seemingly infinite number of ingredients to make mole, the city's claim to fame, is a sight to behold.

And speaking of mole, a sauce made from chocolate and ground chiles and ladled generously over many Mexican specialties: Oaxaca is a food destination in its own right. Diners looking to splurge on a meal should check out Casa Oaxaca , which has duck tacos and smoked octopus as well as a small section of the menu devoted to vegan dishes.

Casual diners (and everyone else) should try Oaxaca's other regional items: the tlayuda. A large griddled tortilla filled with beans, pork fat and cheese, it can be found in restaurants around town and in food markets, such as the Mercado 20 de Noviembre.

After a day or two wandering the picturesque streets, hire a driver or join a tour group and head out of the city center to explore the ruins of Mitla or the city's UNESCO World Heritage site , Monte Albán, a pre-Columbian architectural site.

Plovdiv, the second-largest city in Bulgaria, is getting ready to cement its status on the European city break circuit as one of two European capitals of culture for 2019. (The other is the rocky city of Matera , Italy.)

Known for its Roman ruins, Plovdiv was also the onetime stomping ground of Greeks and Ottomans. Its east-meet-west location means there's a mix of cultural influences, on show at places like the approx 600-year-old Dzhumaya Mosque and the Ottoman-era Chifte Banya -- a 16th century bathhouse that now houses modern art exhibits.

In the summer months, Plovdiv's cobbled streets transform into a bustling festival hub. In June and July, the Opera Open festiva l is in full swing and visitors can catch performances at the city's incredible Roman amphitheater. In the hipster Kapana district, which translates as ""the Trap,"" Kapana Fest offers cultural entertainment in the summer and fall. Wandering Kapana, you'll spot nightclubs neighboring craft shops and plenty of places to soak up the bohemian, laid-back vibe.

Hurricane Irma struck the Caribbean and parts of the southern United States in September 2017, leaving in her wake unprecedented destruction and the daunting task of reconstruction.

Islands such as Barbuda, Turks and Caicos, Tortola and St. Martin suffered extensive damage.

In what is surely one of the exciting periods in the country's history, Weimar -- a small city of 65,000 in Thuringia -- was not only the birthplace of the new republic but also the seat of a modernist revolution in art and design, with repercussions that would be felt around the world.

The Bauhaus art school -- now Bauhaus University -- was founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius and gave us artists such as Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky.

cnn,Should you tip your flight attendant?,[],"(CNN) — Travelers in the United States are used to tipping a multitude of people, from the baristas who make their frothy coffee concoctions to restaurant servers, parking valets, hotel housekeepers and Uber drivers.

But tipping a flight attendant? It's largely unheard of.

Almost all domestic US airlines have policies prohibiting flight attendants from accepting tips, but one ultra-low-cost carrier is bucking that tradition. About three years ago, Frontier Airlines introduced new technology to its inflight payment system that explicitly gives passengers the option to tip flight attendants.

Not that anyone seemed to notice at the time.

Related content The world's most punctual airports and airlines for 2019 revealed

Tipping a flight attendant was a new concept for J.T. Genter, a senior writer at The Points Guy website, who has flown over 350 flights on 51 airlines in the past three years.

Several weeks ago, Genter recounted his surprise at being prompted to tip his Frontier flight attendant after ordering a can of ginger ale. His anecdote went viral and got many travelers wondering if flight attendants will be the next group of workers we'll be tipping.

Behind the mentality

""We appreciate the great work of our flight attendants and know that our customers do as well,"" says Jonathan Freed, a Frontier spokesperson. ""Tipping is entirely at the customer's discretion, and many do it.""

But it's not easy to change tipping culture.

""There can be many motivations for why we want to tip someone,"" says Michael Lynn, a professor at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration, who has written extensively on tipping.

""In general, the dynamic is that we tip people in jobs that are lower status than us. My guess is that most people don't think of flight attendants as being lower status.""

Perhaps not. ""But it's a really hard job. These are people who do a really important job and don't earn tremendous sums of money for doing it,"" says Seth Kaplan, founding editor at Airline Weekly.

So many hats, so little time

Part of what makes a flight attendant's job difficult is that they don so many hats.

""Flight attendants are certified for our safety, health and security work,"" says Sara Nelson, International President of the Association of Flight Attendants , the union that represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 US airlines, including Frontier. As ""aviation's first responders,"" says Nelson, the flight attendant's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of passengers.

Related content Dad books flights to spend Christmas with flight attendant daughter

Of course, flight attendants also serve food and drinks, and the service component of the job is typically what is most visible to passengers. ""In terms of where they see flight attendants putting most of their time and energy, it's mostly serving passengers,"" says Lynn.

Fewer passengers may realize that a flight attendant is also a salesperson.

""On almost every airline in the United States, flight attendants are getting on the loudspeaker and announcing that they have this great deal on a credit card. When people get approved for the credit card, the flight attendant gets a bonus,"" says Brian Sumers, aviation business editor at Skift, the travel intel site.

l e v a r t

That sales hat is considerably bigger if you work on an ultra-low-cost carrier like Frontier, where everything, from overhead bin space to non-alcoholic beverages, costs extra -- and that's where tipping comes in. When a passenger buys a bottle of water, can of soda or bag of chips, the flight attendant presents the bill on a tablet interface that includes a gratuity option.

""We had to learn the interface as part of the flight attendant training program when we started,"" says a woman who worked as a Frontier flight attendant for three years, until late 2018, and has asked not to be identified for fear of negatively impacting her career within the industry.

Flight attendants can control whether to reveal the tip screen before handing the tablet to the passenger for a signature.

The flight attendant says she would occasionally skip the tip screen if a passenger only ordered a bottle of water or if there was a big language barrier. ""It sometimes created awkward interactions with passengers and it didn't make a huge impact in my take-home pay.""

Related content Airline etiquette in the not-so-friendly skies

She notes that she never made more than $100 in tips in a single month, even though she worked significantly more than full-time hours.

""Full time"" for flight attendants is significantly more than 40 hours a week.

Flight attendants are only paid for hours when the door to the aircraft is shut, which means they end up working a ton of off-the-clock hours. This is an industry-wide guideline and not exclusive to Frontier. Tipping could become one way to help cover that technically unpaid time.

""I definitely used the tipping feature on my tablet,"" she adds. ""Frontier flight attendants are the lowest paid in the industry, so a little bit of extra cash from the tips was greatly appreciated.""

For comparison, Frontier flight attendants make 25-30% less than flight attendants at another national ultra-low-cost carrier, Spirit Airlines, according to the Association of Flight Attendants.

Tipping as appeasement

Nelson says Frontier introduced tipping around the time it began negotiating a new contract with the flight attendant union ""in hopes it would dissuade flight attendants from standing together for a fair contract -- and in an effort to shift additional costs to passengers."" Contract negotiations between the two parties have been going on since 2016.

""It's not going very well, and it's getting heated on both sides,"" says Sumers. Frontier flight attendants have picketed at Frontier-hub airports since last spring and, last November, they authorized a strike.

Related content Why does food taste different on planes?

Frontier tweaked its tipping policy at the beginning of the year. Flight attendants used to pool their tips, ""but as the program matured over the past three years, flight attendants asked that individuals be able to keep their own tips,"" says Freed.

In response, flight attendants say they made that request only to gain greater transparency. ""Even though we were told tips got split evenly among the crew, we never got any reports,"" says the former Frontier flight attendant.

While the AFA has always objected to tipping flight attendants, says Nelson, ""our union also ensures this management initiative is implemented fairly and fully. Recently, management failed to properly distribute the tips passengers intended to give to the crew.""

Follow the industry leaders

""I definitely don't know a lot of Frontier flight attendants who would be upset if tipping just went away,"" says the flight attendant.

Instead, she thinks the company is going to use tipping as an incentive to increase sales. ""I always heard rumors that the next step was going to be a quota for drinks and snacks we had to sell on the plane.""

""I can't say that I'm surprised it's Frontier that came out with this first instead of, say, American, United or Delta,"" says Sumers. ""Sometimes an ultra-low-cost carrier will do things that other airlines won't in order to lower costs and to keep revenue up.""

According to a 2018 report from Airline Weekly, the no-frills carriers tend to have better operating margins than most of the legacy carriers. Whether the two other national ultra-low-cost airlines will follow Frontier's lead and introduce tipping is anyone's guess. For now, Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air don't include tipping in their customer-payment systems.

""But it is a very competitive industry,"" says Kaplan. ""If you have Frontier doing this and getting away with it -- and I don't mean to say that as that it's something nefarious -- but if Frontier is doing it then I'm sure it's something that Spirit and Allegiant are looking at, too.""",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/tipping-flight-attendants/index.html,2019-01-30 10:42:44+00:00

Across Dubai myriad construction projects are underway in the lead up to World Expo 2020 . But it turns out there's always room for one more. State-owned investment firm Dubai Holding has released details of a huge post-expo construction mega-project, which will include a 1,804 feet (550-meter) high tower -- taller than One World Trade Center in New York.

The tower, called Burj Jumeira, is situated in the Al Sufouh area of Dubai close to the Burj Al Arab. Plans show it will be surrounded by a mixed-use, residential and commercial zone dubbed ""Downtown Jumeria"" (not to be confused with Downtown Dubai, the location surrounding the Burj Khalifa to the north).

Rather than wait until post-expo to start building, construction is set to begin immediately, according to a company press release, with the first phase to be completed in 2023.

Burj Jumeira's design is said to be inspired by desert dunes and oases according to Dubai Holding, and will feature a platform at 1,476 feet (450 meters) with sky lounge and restaurant. An observation deck will also afford 360-degree views across the city.

Perhaps the tower's most distinctive feature is its base, designed in the outline of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid's thumbprint. There's plans for an amphitheater within the thumbprint for cultural events, as well as a water fountain.

If some of its features sound similar to the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest building at 2,716 feet (828 meters) high -- the Burj Jumeria will also be covered in a digital display capable of lighting up the tower.

When it breaks ground it will join 13 other ""supertall"" -- 300 meter (984 feet) or more -- structures under construction in Dubai according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat

Five miles east of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai Creek Tower is mid-construction and when completed will be the tallest tower in the world at 3,045 feet (928 meters). Around the Santiago Calatrava-designed tower will be multiple new residential towers along with Dubai Square Mall , a $2 billion tech-driven mega-mall the size of 100 soccer fields.

Meydan One , southeast of the Burj Khalifa, is also in construction and is projected to include a mall, the world's longest indoor ski slope and a 2,335-foot (711 meter) high residential tower called Dubai One Tower. Last December developer Meydan told local news the mall was still on track for a 2020 launch.

Petrodollars and the abundant disposable income enjoyed by Dubai's elites -- both local and expat -- means a high concentration of luxury vehicles on the city's streets. People want the newest models -- and they want them now.

In 2015, Nasrullah Chaudhry and Faiyaz Chand co-founded the quick-quote auto trader We Cash Any Car to take advantage of this. ""We've seen that, on average, people hold on to their cars for less than two and a half years, whereas in some more mature European markets it's almost double that,"" says Chaudhry.

The pair describe sellers buying cars they later regretted, as well as vehicles that were received as unwanted gifts or won in lotteries. ""We've had cars come in with 50 kilometers on the clock,"" Chaudhry said.

(CNN) — Four kilometers off the Dubai coastline lies Europe. Or a version of it, at least.

Comprising six man-made islands styled after a mix of European countries and cities, when completed this $5 billion megaproject will be able to accommodate 16,000 tourists in the height of travel luxury.

In this Europe the sun nearly always shines, the ocean's warm and white sands are never far away. There's Venice and St Petersburg, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland and more. And, if you have the money, it could be yours for a vacation or a lifetime.

Called The Heart of Europe and currently under construction, it's the latest chapter in one of Dubai's grandest -- and most eyebrow-raising -- enterprises: The World.

Construction of The World began in 2003. A huge archipelago of 300 artificial islands in the shape of a world map, it was pitched as a playground for the rich and famous.

To make the islands, 34 billion tonnes of large rocks and 320 million cubic meters of sand were deposited in the sea over millions of square feet. So vast was the project, astronauts were able to track its progress from space

The Heart of Europe covers 13 hotels and resorts and more than 4,000 holiday homes. Featuring climate-controlled streets and underwater bedrooms, the complex spans six million square feet and will be able to accommodate up to 16,000 people at any one time when completed, say Kleindienst.

The first phase of construction includes 10 waterfront ""palaces"" on Sweden Island, 32 villas on Germany Island and 78 floating homes dubbed ""Floating Seahorses"" surrounding St Petersburg Island.

On land, one Swedish ""palace"" is already finished, with Scandi-influenced design throughout and a roof shaped like an upturned Viking ship. The other nine are 70% completed, say Kleindienst. The heart-shaped, honeymoon-themed St Petersburg is fully formed and Germany's Bauhaus-inspired villas are also taking shape. The first Floating Seahorse - Signature Edition (a larger model) has been recently completed and another 20 standard models are in construction.

Handover of properties begins this year and will be completed in 2020, say Kleindienst. The developer is targeting second-home buyers and says it has already sold 85% of its units, with 70% of buyers from the UAE and wider Gulf Cooperation Council nations.

Chairman Josef Kleindienst said The Heart of Europe aims to be a ""staycation"" destination. ""We want to be such a place where people from Dubai and from the UAE are attracted to spend their own vacation here in their own country,"" he told CNN. Although he added ""we want to attract tourists from all over the place.""

All 10 properties on Sweden have already been sold, the Austrian businessman told local news last year -- eight to billionaires from the Middle East and another two to billionaires from Europe -- as well as every villa on Germany Island.

Kleindienst says phase two consists of two holiday resorts on ""Main Europe"" -- a mixed themed island -- inspired by Portofino, Italy and the Cote d'Azur in France, scheduled for completion in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

Among the attractions will be artificial coral reefs for diving and snorkeling, created by Kleindienst's Marine Life Sciences Center, based on the archipelago.

""The main goal is to create a vibrant, diverse and sustainable marine habitat,"" Adrian Evans, a marine biologist at the center, told CNN. The developers say the center is growing an additional 100,000 corals a year.

For those who prefer to stay dry, the Floating Seahorses allow visitors to watch marine life from their underwater bedrooms and bathrooms.

If Kleindienst's project proceeds as planned, there will also be a slew of underwater rooms throughout The Floating Venice, another of the themed complexes planned for The Heart of Europe. That is considered part of phase three of the development, along with chalets on Switzerland Island and nine other hotels on Main Europe.

Richard Thompson, editor for Middle East Economic Digest, told CNN he's witnessing a shift in tourism demands.

""People are looking for experiences, they're no longer looking to have a bit of luxury on a beach,"" he said. ""They want to have an adventure, they want to have something for their social media pages, they want something unique that helps them as individuals develop their own life story.""

So what of the rest of The World? Almost all its islands remain undeveloped, but there are rumblings that holiday destinations could soon pop up elsewhere.

And twice a week, they come to a gym in Cosmo City, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, to box. They are affectionately known as South Africa's ""boxing grannies,"" and these women are juking and jabbing their way to healthier lives.

""My life was on and off, you know -- sometimes good, sometimes bad,"" said 80-year-old Constance Ngubane, who's been coming in to box since the Boxing Gogos (another name for ""grandmother"" in South Africa) program began in 2014. ""But since I started boxing ... I feel young, like I'm 16. But I'm not 16; I'm 80!""

Constance Ngubane says she feels less like her 80 years and more like age 16 when she's boxing.

For these women, boxing is as much a social activity as it is a physical one, and it is that combination that can boost the benefits of exercise. A study from the Mayo Clinic found that physical activities with more social interaction were associated with a longer lifespan.

""I love to mix with the other grannies,"" Ngubane said. ""They are like family.""

The social aspect of longevity has long fascinated researchers, gaining attention alongside more tangible measurables like diet, exercise and smoking.

cnn,High-fiber diet linked to lower risk of death and chronic diseases,['Nina Avramova'],"(CNN) People who eat diets that are high in fiber have lower risk of death and chronic diseases such as stroke or cancer compared with people with low fiber intake, a new analysis found.

Dietary fiber includes plant-based carbohydrates such as whole-grain cereal, seeds and some legumes. Fiber's health benefits have been recorded ""by over 100 years of research,"" Andrew Reynolds, a researcher at the University of Otago in New Zealand, wrote in an email. He is co-author of the new meta-analysis of existing research, which was published Thursday in the journal The Lancet .

The research shows that higher intakes of fiber ""led to a reduced incidence of a surprisingly broad range of relevant diseases (heart disease, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer),"" reduced body weight and total cholesterol, and reduced mortality, Reynolds wrote. Similar findings were shown with increasing whole-grain intakes.

Reynolds' team was commissioned by the World Health Organization to inform future fiber intake recommendations.

The researchers analyzed over 180 observational studies and 50 clinical trials from the past four decades; that's the strength of the analysis, explained co-author Jim Mann, professor of human nutrition and medicine at the University of Otago.

""The health benefits of dietary fiber appear to be even greater than we thought previously,"" Mann said of the results.

The analysis found a 15% to 30% reduced risk of death and chronic diseases in people who included the most fiber in their diets, compared with those with the lowest intake.

A fiber-rich diet was linked, on average, to a 22% reduced risk of stroke, a 16% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer, and a 30% reduced risk of death from coronary heart disease.

Most people globally consume about 20 grams (0.70 ounces) of dietary fiber per day, Mann said of the findings. Based on the research, he recommends 25 grams (0.88 ounces) to 29 grams (1.02 ounces) of fiber each day. Higher amounts are even more beneficial, according to the analysis.

A 15-gram (0.52 ounce) increase in whole grains consumed per day was associated with a 2% to 19% reduction in total deaths and incidences of coronary heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer.

The study notes that the relationships between high fiber/whole grain consumption and reduced noncommunicable diseases could be causal.

The analysis found no dangers with a high fiber intake. But it adds that for people with an iron deficiency, high levels of whole grains can further reduce iron levels.

The authors note that carbohydrates include sugars, starches and dietary fiber. ""However sugars, starches, and fibres are all carbohydrates that perform different roles in the body,"" Reynolds wrote.

Fiber content was shown to be a better indicator of a carbohydrate food's ability to prevent disease than glycemic index, the measure of the degree to which blood glucose goes up after a particular food is eaten.

The study found small risk reduction in stroke and Type 2 diabetes for people adhering to a low-glycemic-index diet, which involves foods like green vegetables, most fruits, kidney beans and bran breakfast cereals.

Glycemic index is not as good as dietary fiber when considering whether something is a good carbohydrate-containing food, Mann said. Foods that don't increase blood glucose may still be high in sugars, saturated fats and sodium. Ice cream, for example, has a low glycemic index but is high in sugar.

One limitation of the analysis is that the studies involved only healthy individuals, so the findings do not apply to people with pre-existing chronic conditions. Also, most studies were conducted in Western societies; it is not ""100% certain"" that the results therefore apply to less-privileged societies, Mann explained.

Brian Power, a dietician and lecturer in nutrition at University College London, said the analysis is ""very robust"" and ""powerful."" Power, who was not involved in the research, said it is the ""highest form of evidence in terms of summarizing what we know.""

""Any increase in dietary fiber has health benefits,"" he added, and it takes only small changes in diet to achieve a health benefit. A person could add 8 grams of fiber to their diet with a breakfast of a bran flakes, four dried apricots and a handful of almonds.

Reynolds advised, ""Practical ways to increase fibre intake is to base meals and snacks around whole grains, vegetables, pulses, and whole fruits.""

Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, wrote in an email that ""living a healthy lifestyle is an obvious route to improving our health outcomes, and eating a balanced diet, as well as taking regular exercise, getting enough sleep, drinking alcohol in moderation and not smoking, is a key part of this.""

""We've known for a long time that eating foods high in fibre is good for us and helps to aid digestion,"" wrote Stokes-Lampard, who was not involved in the new analysis, ""so it's reassuring to see this high-quality research showing how far-reaching these benefits may be for our long-term health and wellbeing, and confirming why it's so important to include these foods in our diet.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/10/health/high-fiber-diet-weight-loss-mortality-study-intl/index.html,2019-01-10 00:00:00

It's made a superstar out of one meat-loving chef, Internet sensation Salt Bae, and continues to tantalize the taste buds of millions of visitors every year.

Food and the hospitality that goes with it, say the experts, is the best way to understand the collision of cultures brought to Istanbul by migrants from across not just Turkey but Eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

In fact, Istanbul is probably the only place in Turkey where you can sample cuisine from every region in the country and beyond.

One dish in particular.

""We could travel around Istanbul eating kebab only, and experience every region of Turkey,"" says Ansel Mullins, writer and founder of food tour company Culinary Backstreets

""Regionality is a really important subject, the migration of people from all over Turkey to Istanbul for economic reasons, or to escape dangerous places in the country in previous decades,"" he adds.

The city's make up, with the Bosphorus Strait acting as a natural border between its European and Asian sections, has played a huge role in its progression.

""There is a cultural tornado going on here,"" says Turkish psychologist and author Akilah Azra Kohen, who lives in Istanbul.

""Being in the middle of two continents, this is a necessity for combining all of the cultures and all of the people's needs.""

There's no denying that Istanbul's chaotic vibe can be difficult to navigate at times.

But according to Mullins, the best way to understand this majestic city is to examine the cuisine served up in its 39 districts and 936 neighborhoods.

Meat map

A myriad of culinary influences makes Istanbul a true foodie paradise, especially for kebab fans.

From region to region, there are subtle differences in traditional Turkish cuisine that can be traced back to the roots of residents who moved here from different parts of Turkey.

Especially kebabs.

In some Western countries, the word ""kebab"" is synonymous with cheap fast food -- often consumed after a night out. In Turkey it describes not just meat, but anything roasted over an open fire.

Döner kebab, which literally translates to ""rotating kebab,"" is one of the most well known internationally, as is Shish kebab, small cubes of meat or fish threaded on a skewer and grilled, but there are many other different forms.

The area of Kadinlar Pazari in the Fatih district is famed for its Buryan kebab, as well as perde pilavı, both of which are specialities of Siirt, the town on Turkey's Syrian border where much of the residents here hail from.

Preserving tradition

Made with lamb cooked over coal in an underground pit, Siirt-style Buryan kebab is a much-coveted delicacy.

The best Buryan kebab in Istanbul can be found at local restaurant Siirt Seref, according to those in the know. ( Siirt Seref, Zeyrek Mh., İtfaiye Cd. No:4, 34083 Fatih/İstanbul; +90 212 635 80 85).

""I think this place is a great representation of the city,"" Mullins says of the popular restaurant run by the Avci family, who migrated her from Siirt many years ago.

""It's the story of a family coming from a faraway place and preserving a tradition.

""But at the same time, fitting into this urban atmosphere of Istanbul -- and thriving.""

Lamb is likely to be prepared in a totally different way in areas neighboring Kadinlar Pazari.

In fact, you could venture down the street and witness chefs grilling lamb over hot coals, as is custom in the city of Urfa in southeastern Turkey, which the Urfa kebab is named after.

In Siirt Seref, owner Levent Avci takes great pride in showcasing his hometown's pit cooking process, while his father, former owner Seref Avci, looks on to ensure that everything is done as it always has been.

Forgotten recipes

This level of dedication is commonplace in the city, particularly among members of the older generation, who are hugely proud of their culinary traditions and intent on preserving them.

In fact, influential chef Musa Dağdeviren is so passionate about safeguarding the legacy of Turkish cooking practices that he's developing an institute to train the next generation in traditional gastronomy.

""People who live in the cities don't know their traditions,"" Dağdeviren, who hails from the town of Nizip in southern Turkey, tells CNN.

""They seem to have completely forgotten about their culinary past.""

Dagdeviren has appeared on Netflix series ""Chef's Table"" and is renowned for re-discovering and rejuvenating Turkish recipes on the verge of extinction.

His restaurant Ciya Sofrasi , situated on the Asian side of Istanbul, attracts customers from all over the world thanks to its daily changing menu made up of traditional regional dishes. ( Ciya Sofrasi , Caferağa Mahallesi, Güneşli Bahçe Sk. No:43, 34710 Kadıköy/İstanbul; Phone: +90 216 330 31 90)

Dagdeviren has been instrumental in ensuring the regional recipes in villages throughout Turkey are recorded, not only by adding many to his restaurant's menu, but also in books issued through Ciya Publications , a publishing house founded by his wife Zeynep Dağdeviren.

""In a way, traditional dishes form the basis of our heritage,"" he adds.

""We need to protect the values of our land and culture, for it's these facets that form the backbone of past civilizations.""

Meat performances

Nusret Gökçe, also known as ""Salt Bae,"" is a restaurateur putting the Turkish city on the map thanks to his Instagram fame.

Another passionate restaurateur helping to put Turkey's food scene in the spotlight, albeit for less than conventional reasons, is Nusret Gökçe, also known as ""Salt Bae.""

Born in Erzurum on the Asian side of Istanbul, his culinary career began earlier than most.

Gökçe was forced to quit school and take up work as a butcher's apprentice when he was aged about 11 due to his family's limited finances.

He set up an eatery in Turkey's largest city after working in restaurants in Argentina and went on to become an online sensation thanks to his flamboyant style of preparing and sprinkling salt on meat.

Gökçe, now 36, used his Internet fame to turn his Istanbul restaurant into a worldwide eponymous chain of steakhouses, with branches in New York, Miami and Dubai.

The popularity of the Nusr-Et restaurants is credited to the former butcher's ""performance"" skills and he enjoys putting on a show for diners.

""This work has become my everything,"" says Gökçe, who currently has 18 million Instagram followers.

""When I see the meat, I mean -- to touch it -- to cut it -- to serve it -- what people feel when they eat it, when I see all of that it makes me happy.""

While Gökçe's story is unusual, his success is testament to Istanbul's powerful connection to food.

Miracle city

It's hard to find a more hospitable city than this one. Visitors don't need to travel far before being offered something to eat or drink by a well-meaning resident.

While this cordiality remains as strong as ever, to say Istanbul's resilience has been tested by the civil war in Syria, which broke out in 2011, is something of an understatement.

A series of terror attacks, not to mention an attempted coup in 2016, led to Turkey receiving a Level 3 travel advisory categorization, but tourism is beginning to rise again.

cnn,Meet the new faces of London,[],"(CNN) — With a past dating back to Roman times, London is widely known as the home of ritual, royalty, elitism and elegance.

But beneath the layers of history and grandeur lies a multifaceted destination brimming with diversity and individuality.

More than 300 languages are spoken in the capital, and one in three Londoners were born outside the UK (with one in four born outside of Europe.)

""London is an extraordinary city, because it is such a melting pot. There are people from all over the world that make this city their home, and everybody is welcome,"" London born actress Naomie Harris, who starred in Bond movies ""Skyfall"" and Spectre,"" tells CNN.

""It's an incredibly diverse city. I love the energy of it.""

Breaking down barriers

London's Kingdom Choir brought its musical message of love to the world at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle,

While this cultural mix hasn't always been reflected on the main stage, it was proudly on display at the wedding of the UK's Prince Harry and US actress Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, in May 2018.

One of the most notable moments from the ceremony, besides a rousing sermon from Bishop Michael Curry, was a rendition of Ben E. King's ""Stand By Me"" by Kingdom Choir.

""I felt that there was a coming together of communities,"" says Karen Gibson, founder and conductor of the London gospel choir, says of the performance, which was watched by a estimated two billion around the world.

As a child of the Windrush generation -- Caribbean immigrants invited to move to the UK by the British government to help with rebuilding after World War II -- Gibson's invitation to perform before the Queen was a clear sign of how far the city has come in breaking down its traditional class systems and embracing its diverse population.

""This 4-year-old child, when she saw us on TV she said, 'Look mommy, they look like me,' she adds. ""The exclusion is not what it was.""

The performance was a historic moment, as was the addition of Markle, a biracial American, to the British Royal family, where tradition is a fundamental part of everyday life.

For while aristocrats are now a dying breed in the city, the Royals still have a huge amount of clout.

Magnet for rich people

""There's only one grand family that matters in this town, and that is the monarchy,"" Peter York, a cultural commentator and co-author of the 1980s book ""The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook,"" tells CNN.

""The old world, the pre-war world of dukes and earls with grand houses in central London has utterly gone.

""At the very center of London, the rich people come from everywhere. It couldn't be more international.""

Encompassing more than 270 nationalities, there's no doubt that London is a truly global city.

It became the first major Western city to elect a Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, in 2016.

But while diversity is one of its strengths, the city also has its fair share of challenges.

For instance, the deprivation gap is increasing here, while inequality in income, employment and quality of life is also on the rise.

This means London is home to some of the UK's poorest citizens as well as its richest.

Although this clash of cultures has helped to create enrichment and innovation, it's also led to tension and division in some sections of the city.

Quite literally crossing this divide is youth theater group Intermission, a project that sees 16 to 25-year-olds from some of the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods get together to perform the works of William Shakespeare in a church next to luxury department store Harrods in London's Knightsbridge.

Founded in 2008 by ex-offender Darren Raymond, who discovered the playwright while serving time in prison, Intermission aims to inspire and engage vulnerable young people considered at risk of committing crime or reoffending.

""Drama is incredibly powerful, because it gives people an opportunity, especially young people who are not encouraged to voice their feelings,"" explains Harris, who acts as a patron for Intermission.

""It gives them a platform to express themselves in a way that's safe, where they feel nurtured.""

Shakespearean knife crime

London theater group Intermission blends classic Shakespeare with the language of the street to engage disadvantaged and vulnerable people at risk of getting involved in crime

Raymond helps the young people who come here connect with Shakespeare by reframing the words in language they can relate to, drawing parallels between the writer's classic plays and modern issues such as knife crime, which rose to its highest ever level in London in 2018.

""To me, Julius Caesar is the ultimate knife crime [story],"" he says. ""He gets stabbed to death by conspirators, and we see a lot of that in the inner cities.""

While London still has a way to go in bridging some of its cultural gaps, Raymond feels that staging projects like this in the city's richest areas is a step in the right direction.

""These people [the group] are from all over London, but we come to Knightsbridge, which is a very affluent area, and are able to be ourselves,"" he adds.

""When two worlds meet, beautiful things happen. We are in this world together, regardless of our race, our background, or class. We need to start breaking down these stereotypes.""

Of course, London's diversity goes far beyond race and class.

'Night flowers'

l e v a r t

From the mods of the 1960s, to the punk scene of the '70s, to '80s goth culture, the city has long been a breeding ground for the subversive.

One of the capital's latest underground movements comes in the form of a group of men and women who frequent the streets of Soho in the early hours of the morning dressed in outlandish drag, complete with intricate headpieces and stage makeup.

Dubbed the ""night flowers"" by photographer Damien Frost, who spent a year capturing them on camera, they lurk in the shadows, coming out to ""bloom"" when the sun goes down.

""It's a total expressionist movement,"" an unnamed night flower explains.

""You can call it drag, but there could be many names given to it. It's not necessarily female or male.""

While the night flowers are from all different parts of the country, the vibrant environment of London is where they come to life, allowing what they describe as ""imagined versions of themselves"" to exist in the real world.

""London has always had eccentrics,"" explains Frost. ""I guess this is an extension of that. A lot of the people that do this come from smaller towns. They move to London, and suddenly they can blossom.""

This group of extroverts join a long line of individuals who have relocated to London to ""blossom.""

An average of 192,000 people a year moved to London from abroad between 2011 and 2015 and the capital's population is predicted to reach 9.8 million by 2025.

This evolving city continues to attract people from all walks of life, largely thanks to its vivacity and inclusiveness.

cnn,"Is Nairobi, Kenya, the fastest city on the planet?",[],"(CNN) — Nairobi's only been a city since 1954, but it's been making up for lost time ever since.

The capital of Kenya is now a thriving metropolis that continues to grow rapidly in a country that covers 582,650 square kilometers (around twice the size of Nevada). Nairobi is always on the move, always changing.

While its name comes from a Maasai phrase meaning ""the place of cool waters,"" Nairobi is more commonly referred to as the ""Green City in the Sun.""

Positioned between Somalia and Tanzania in Eastern Africa, it's a place where residents and wild beasts live in close proximity -- and might be the only city with a safari park on its doorstep.

Now one of Africa's most influential cities, Nairobi is a vital commercial and financial regional hub, home to the regional headquarters of various major international companies and organizations. It's also got the highest number of malls in Kenya.

Despite its youth, Nairobi's growth rate has been one of the highest of any African city, with major real estate projects and skyscrapers regularly popping up on its burgeoning skyline.

""There's a lot of entrepreneurship going on in Nairobi. Everybody is busy creating a life,"" says Najib Balala, Kenya's minister of tourism. ""Also, the vibrancy of the city, wharf and business and tourism and hospitality, every part of Nairobi is fast.

""I come from Mombasa. When I come to Nairobi, I find myself in a different landscape. Here people are moving fast, and people want to get things done.""

The city's population has also risen, doubling in size since 1986.

In fact the only thing that moves slowly in Nairobi is the traffic, a bone of contention for travelers and locals alike.

Birth of a city

Its growth can largely be traced back to the arrival of the railway system, without which the city as we know it would not exist.

The two have been intertwined since 1895, when the British were busy connecting parts of its empire by building a railroad from Mombasa on Kenya's coast to the neighboring colony -- Uganda.

With an elevation of 5,889 feet above sea level, the area was chosen as a stopover point due to its cool temperature and the availability of food and water. In 1899 Nairobi was founded by the colonial authorities as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway.

""It's the railway that created Nairobi ... as the city,"" explains Nairobi Railway Museum curator Randiga Aron Elias.

Related content Berlin: The city where anything goes

""The first buildings began when the railway reached Nairobi. Otherwise it was just a vast land where the only possibility was raising animals.""

The Uganda Railway was constructed by Indian slaves brought over to work in terrible conditions. Some were even eaten by lions as they worked on the railroad.

But despite the horrendous circumstances behind it, Kenya recognizes that legacy and is preserving it at the museum.

""Our great founding father told us, 'Don't forget, but forgive.' That's why we have peace with what our past is all about. We moved forward,"" says Balala.

""[It was] very painful, but we have moved on, and we try to improve what was the foundation [of Kenya].""

Of course, no one could have predicted quite such an improvement.

The one-time shanty town went on to replace Machakos as the capital of Kenya in 1907 and remained as such after the country gained independence in 1963.

Safari capital

It may be strange feeding a giraffe with its head through the window but it's truly a World of Wonder.

Now one of Africa's largest cities, Nairobi has long been the safari capital of the continent and its National Park plays a major part in the structure of the city.

Measuring about 134 square kilometers, it's home to more than 400 species of birds as well as a plethora of animals, including buffaloes, leopards, lions and rhinos and has the rather unusual backdrop of city skyscrapers and landing planes.

This sharp contrast between the wild and the city -- an electric fence the only thing separating them -- is about as unique a wildlife offering as it gets.

After all, where else in the world can you witness at least four of the big five living next to half a million residents?

While conservation activists have voiced concerns about the threat Nairobi's continuing advancement poses to its landscape, Balala believes that Africa's oldest national park and the Karura Forest, with its Sykes' monkeys and towering trees, play a huge role in Nairobi's flourishing.

""The greenery and the ecosystem support Nairobi as a healthy city,"" he explains. ""Look at the freshness of this weather!

""We say that half the land of Nairobi is Nairobi National Park. The other land is Karura Forest.""

Nature is the heartbeat of Nairobi and its wildlife has helped to attract travelers to Kenya for many years.

Bright future

Reverand Kathy Kiuna: ""Nairobians are very happy, thriving, exciting human beings."" Jonathan Hawkins/CNN

The number of visitors to the country is currently on the up, with tourism earnings increasing by 20% in 2017.

Nairobi was also recently named as one of the top 10 destinations on the rise by travel and restaurant review site TripAdvisor, which listed the Karen Blixen Museum , the former home of ""Out of Africa"" author Karen Blixen, and the Giraffe Center, established to protect the endangered Rothschild giraffe, as its top sights, along with the national park.

But what is the true essence of the city?

Reverend Kathy Kiuna, who co-founded Nairobi's Jubilee Christian Church with her husband in 1989, attributes the success of Nairobi to its people.

""It's the Nairobians,"" says Reverend Kiuna. ""They make Nairobi because Nairobians are very happy, thriving, exciting human beings.

""They are so vibrant. They live for real. We live life. It's not a rehearsal.""

Radio personality Shaffie Weru, who was born and bred in the city, wholeheartedly agrees with this sentiment.

As Nairobi continues to make advancements, the one thing that remains constant is its limitless energy. This place is so full of life.

OJ Simpson and Donald Trump 1993. (John Barrett/PHOTOlink.net/MediaPunch/IPX)

When O.J. Simpson was approached in a Las Vegas parking lot on Tuesday, a tabloid reporter asked about President Trump’s imminent address to Congress.

“What do you think about your buddy’s State of the Union tonight?” a TMZ reporter asked.

He demurred at first. Trump was a friend, he explained to TMZ. Simpson was even a guest at Trump’s second wedding in 1993, months before the gruesome double murder that would send Simpson to trial.

But that far in the past, when Simpson the football megastar knew Trump, the brash Manhattan tycoon — before their lives took wildly divergent paths. “I don’t know the president,” Simpson said. “I stay out of politics.""

But avoiding politics would be hard to avoid if Trump was impeached. TMZ asked Simpson: did the former NFL star think that could happen?

“If he keeps hanging around with people like that Roger Stone,” Simpson said, referring to Trump’s longest-serving political adviser who was arrested last month and charged with seven counts, including lying to investigators, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

Stone criticized the FBI raid, calling it an overreach with more force used in raids involving Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Guzmán was captured amid deadly urban combat and bin Laden was shot twice in the head by a Navy SEAL before his corpse was dumped into the sea.

Simpson, a man with vast experience in the criminal justice system, pivoted his advice to Stone in a flash of showmanship that never quite left his body, even after the murder charges, the civil suits and felony convictions that sent him to prison for years.

[O.J. Simpson is granted parole, closing another chapter in a never-ending saga]

“Let me say this. You know, I got raided by the FBI in Miami,” Simpson said, an apparent reference to a 2001 drug investigation that did not result in charges. ""30-something FBI agents, 5 o clock in the morning, and I had more than dogs. I had kids there.”

Simpson added: “The FBI can be wrong, but to try and compare it to ‘El Chapo’ and bin Laden? Hey man, bin Laden was carried out in a bag, not walked out in handcuffs. So man up, stop crying.”

Trump’s connection to Simpson emerged in different ways after Simpson was accused in the 1994 murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in Los Angeles.

In the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, “O.J.: Made in America,” one scene shows Simpson’s legal team rearranging his house to make him more appealing to the jurors in his murder trial. Among the changes made was removing photos showing him with wealthy white friends, including Trump.

Trump had also sought Simpson to appear on the “Celebrity Apprentice” television show, he told Howard Stern in 2008.

Simpson was acquitted of the murders, but he was later found to be liable for the deaths of Brown Simpson and Goldman in a civil suit.

He was sentenced to 33 years in prison following charges of armed robbery and kidnapping in a 2007 confrontation involving sports memorabilia. He was paroled in 2017.

washingtonpost,Ruth Bader Ginsburg was seen in public Monday. Conspiracy theorists still insist she’s dead.,"['Eli Rosenberg', 'General Assignment Reporter Covering National', 'Breaking News', 'Reporter Covering Digital Culture', 'February At Am', ""Eli Rosenberg Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S General Assignment Team. He Has Worked At The New York Times"", 'The New York Daily News.', 'Abohlheiser Covers Digital Culture For The Washington Post. She Was Previously A General Assignment Reporter For The Post', 'Focusing On National Breaking News']","Robert Barnes has been a reporter and editor at The Washington Post for more than 30 years. For the past 12, he has covered the Supreme Court.

This week he experienced something he says was a first in his career: a storm of commentators, many anonymous, swarming his social media accounts and email inbox to tell him that something he saw with his own eyes and reported in The Post did not actually happen: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, alive and well, attending a performance about her life at a museum in Washington — her first public appearance since she underwent cancer surgery in December.

A falsehood has been spreading in dark corners of the Internet that Ginsburg is dead — and in the hours after Barnes published his report, conspiracy theorists pelted him with their doubt-mongering. Photos were not allowed at the event, so one of the doubters emailed Barnes 21 questions about Ginsburg’s appearance — the size of her security detail, what gender they were, for example — telling Barnes that if he did not answer every single one of them, it would be a sign his article was not to be believed.

Ginsburg did not attend the State of the Union on Tuesday night. Neither did Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Sonia Sotomayor or Stephen G. Breyer, but the conspiracy theory that Ginsburg is dead may draw more oxygen from the 85-year-old justice’s absence.

Conspiracy theories about political figures are not new, but social media and other digital tools that allow for and, at times, encourage their wide dissemination have given them new prominence in the Trump era. Though it is impossible to know how large these groups are, the disruption they cause far exceeds their size, in part because of the visibility that social media algorithms lends to assertions that fire people up, regardless of the veracity of those claims.

But there is often more to these movements than is first apparent.

[The world’s oldest person record stood for decades. Then came a Russian conspiracy theory.]

QAnon, the shorthand for a tale that fantasizes about a vast “deep-state” conspiracy aimed at thwarting President Trump, was presented as an organic movement when it burst into mainstream consciousness over the summer. But reporting later showed that some of the main groups that had spread it were profiting from the attention it helped bring to them.

The Pizzagate conspiracy theory spread through the fringes of right-wing Internet culture to Twitter, where it was amplified by people with huge followings — and also, as it turns out, Russian bots. And the conversation after major news events, such as the Parkland shooting in Florida last year, is routinely distorted by complex processes that lend themselves to gaming and manipulation, experts say, though specific actors and motivations can be hard to discern immediately. They include spurious accounts, trending hashtags supported by bot networks, and opaque algorithms that highlight buzzy content and commentary — no matter what the facts are.

Two anonymous Twitter accounts were behind the edited snippet of video about an encounter between a group of Catholic high school boys and a Native American activist that went viral, for example. One of the accounts was later booted from Twitter after the service said it was manipulating the conversation.

In Ginsburg’s case, questions about her health began to spread around the time she missed the court’s first case, Jan. 7, as she was recovering from surgery she had on Dec. 21. It appears to have originated on the message boards that house the QAnon theory. An anonymous but influential account posted a stew of doubt-mongering, wondering about Ginsburg’s “real medical diagnosis” and wondering what kind of “off-market drugs” were sustaining her.

“The clock is ticking,” the commenter wrote. “PANIC IN DC.”

There was no panic in D.C.

The mini empire of amplifiers, profiteers and fame seekers benefiting from QAnon’s small but passionate audience went to work. Soon, videos questioning the official line on Ginsburg’s health were the top search results for the justice’s name on YouTube. An online petition to impeach her failed to meet a 5,000 signature goal.

But its real boost came when a couple of right-wing personalities with large social media followings engaged it. Ben Garrison, a prominent pro-Trump cartoonist, tweeted about Ginsburg’s whereabouts, musing on his blog about whether liberals would ever keep her death “a secret,” so Trump couldn’t fill the seat with a conservative.

The Fox News show “Fox & Friends” briefly aired a graphic indicating that Ginsburg had died, then quickly apologized. James Woods, an actor who is a mainstay of the conspiracy-laden parts of the pro-Trump Internet, helped get the hashtag #WheresRuth trending on Twitter on Jan. 28. Two days later, Sebastian Gorka — a former adviser of President Trump’s — tweeted “Still no sign” to his 700,000 followers, noting the State of the Union was about a week away.

And then the theory started to draw mainstream coverage — another way that conspiracy theories spread, even when they are properly fact-checked, debunked and contextualized, experts say. And the Twitter hoaxes continued. An anonymous account shared an old photo of the presidential hearse carrying Ronald Reagan’s body past the U.S. Capitol, writing “Prominent DC Funeral Home vehicle seen leaving the Ginsberg estate . . . what’s going on?”

[How a star chef’s angry MAGA-hat tweet triggered a storm of misleading news]

The conspiracy theory lives on in the algorithms.

YouTube is still recommending “RGB dead” as one of its autofill searches. Twitter’s autofill recommendations for “RBG” have an even wider selection: “#RBGWhereYouBe,” “#RGBProofOfLife” and “RBG dead.”

If hoaxers were seeking attention for the theory, they certainly have succeeded. Targeting reporters such as Barnes who have wide followings online is a good way to start. Other reporters who saw Ginsburg on Monday night at the performance were hit with the same flood of replies and emails.

After the Parkland shooting, Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University who has studied the amplification of conspiracy theories, told The Post that conspiracy theorists and hoax spreaders are “really good at seeding a story with an establishment outlet so they can bring that prize back to those far-right circles.”

People know that journalists are on Twitter, searching for news and story ideas. It is considered a victory when those fringe conspiracies are amplified into the mainstream by a reporter who is trying to debunk them.

The Supreme Court has been the target of conspiracy theories before. After Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly at a Texas ranch in 2016, conspiracy theories swirled about the nature of his death, and whether he was murdered as a political hit. The theories, which have no grounding in evidence, live on today.

The Supreme Court doesn’t have another public session until Feb. 19, Barnes said, noting that specialists said there’s a six- to eight-week recovery typically expected for the procedure Ginsburg had undergone.

“It seems logical that she would be back for it,” he said.

Barnes said he is less offended by the suggestion that he was fooled by a body double than that he made up Ginsburg’s appearance Tuesday night.

“Feeling grateful for tweeters who say I, and many others, saw RBG body-double, as opposed to those who think I lied,” he wrote on Twitter. “They won’t be happy if she skips speech tonight, as she has Trump’s first 2. Thomas and Alito not likely either, but, I swear, also alive.”

His parents told reporters that Joshua was sad all the time, a story that found its way to the ears of the first family, who seated Joshua two seats from Melania Trump during the State of the Union address Tuesday night.

And it is from that vaunted position that Joshua got what appeared to be the best sleep of his life — an open-mouthed snoozefest uninterrupted by bipartisan applause, flashing cameras, Nancy Pelosi’s clap or the oration of the leader of the free world.

It’s unclear when, exactly, Joshua fell asleep. During President Trump’s 82-minute speech, some camera angles swept over the crowd at select moments when everyone was standing and clapping — except for the blank space where Joshua should have been.

But an alert photographer appeared to catch the unalert preteen. In the photo, he’s sitting next to Grace Eline, a 10-year-old cancer survivor who, it should be noted, is wide awake. And two seats away, in clear shake-you-awake reach, is Melania Trump.

During President Trump’s State of the Union address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood out among a sea of women wearing white as a tribute to U.S. suffragists.

At times she remained seated as others stood.

And serious while others applauded.

In fact, Ocasio-Cortez’s reaction to Trump’s speech Tuesday night was somber — and it prompted a debate on social media about her “sullen” appearance and the apparent condescension in telling a woman to smile.

After the address, Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan wrote on Twitter that Ocasio-Cortez “had a rare bad night, looking not spirited, warm and original as usual but sullen, teenaged and at a loss.” The comment drew scorn from some people on social media — including from Ocasio-Cortez, who clapped back against critics.

“Why should I be ‘spirited and warm’ for this embarrassment of a # SOTU?” she responded. “Tonight was an unsettling night for our country. The president failed to offer any plan, any vision at all, for our future.

""We’re flying without a pilot. And I‘m not here to comfort anyone about that fact.”

Since her election to Congress, Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has gained widespread attention.

She has also been known to spar with her conservative critics and fire back, too, such as when then-Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called the incoming congresswoman “a bright and shiny new object.”

As her facial expressions gained social media attention Tuesday night, some criticized the congresswoman for her mood.

Actor James Woods posted a meme on Twitter showing Ocasio-Cortez sitting in a straitjacket during the State of the Union address.

“Grumpy little thing… ” he wrote.

But others pointed out that Noonan’s tweet — perceived as the equivalent of telling a woman to smile — was offensive.

It didn’t go over well.

“We’re not going to smile and clap like seals to make him or you comfortable,” Charlotte Clymer, with the Human Rights Campaign, wrote on Twitter.

“Ladies, don’t look serious while a man tries to tell you what you can do with your bodies. Smile like an idiot no matter what, and the world is your oyster!” New York-based journalist Laurie Brookins said.

Ann Olivarius, a lawyer and activist, wrote: “Notice how women are constantly asked to smile. To put others at their ease. To appease. To smooth out our jagged edges, to blunt our rage, and, crucially, always make sure everyone else comfortable. And what does it get us?”

But Ocasio-Cortez didn’t throw shade throughout the entire State of the Union address. She cheered as Trump acknowledged the women in Congress.

“Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote,” the president said, “we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”

washingtonpost,Trump's border security 'national emergency' could be undercut in court by his tweets,"['Deanna Paul', 'Reporter Covering National', 'Breaking News', 'Fred Barbash', 'Law', 'Constitution', 'February At Am']","

President Trump at the White House on Jan. 25. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

For weeks, President Trump has toyed with the idea of invoking emergency authority to build the southern border wall. Despite Senate Republicans’ warnings against an emergency declaration, once again, Trump made a case for one during Tuesday’s State of the Union address, calling the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border “an urgent national crisis.”

In 1976, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, which gave the president the right to pronounce a national emergency on a whim. The act offers no definition of “emergency” and gives the president access to dozens of laws with specialized funds. Although none automatically allocate additional money to the president during a national emergency, legal experts have pointed to two emergency powers that could shift Defense Department funding.

If Trump follows through with a declaration, it will undoubtedly and swiftly be challenged in the courts.

Private landowners whose property is seized under the rule of eminent domain would have standing to file suit. States that were expecting diverted funds could sue, if they can show sufficient injury. Attorneys from environmental and civil rights groups have also made known their intentions to sue.

From Twitter to campaign speeches, Trump has provided plenty of ammunition for potential litigants. Few if any presidents have made so many unguarded and ill-informed statements, and Trump’s have been used quite effectively against his administration and his own policies. Dozens of important policy decisions have been blocked by judges just in the first two years.

Here, challengers may try to use Trump’s words to argue that what’s really motivating him is not an emergency at the border but a campaign promise to build a wall or a dissatisfaction with the legislative process.

Until Trump specifies with which emergency authority he plans to build the wall and which funds he will divert, attorneys for potential litigants can’t fully formulate their arguments. Still, it’s clear that attorneys on both sides will have a lengthy legal battle to prepare for.

The Defenders: ‘The unassailable position of the president’

Justice Department attorneys, working on behalf of the Trump administration, will be looking to prove that declaring a national emergency was within the scope of his presidential authority.

Although Trump has made it more difficult for the Justice Department, border security remains an area with the greatest deference afforded to the executive branch.

“Trump comes to court with what has historically been the unassailable position of the president,” said Jonathan Turley, constitutional law professor at George Washington University. “Courts are leery in challenging these types of emergency declaration, and they have a strict tradition of avoiding political or policy questions.”

The White House could not have done more to magnify the risk of Trump’s tweets by proclaiming early on that they were official statements by the president. It could have distinguished his tweets from official, executive policy but did not.

Trump’s missives do suggest the emergency power has been used as a bargaining chip, but Turley said that there’s nothing in the law that says a president can’t threaten to use the National Emergencies Act before actually using it. It also does not preclude Trump from making a legitimate emergency claim.

Moreover, the fact that Trump has made contradictory statements about the source or rationale of the funding may not be relevant to the court. The court’s focus must be narrower.

[McConnell privately cautions Trump about emergency declaration on border wall]

Experts have drawn parallels to the dynamic that played out with the legal challenges to Trump’s travel ban, which barred travelers from eight countries, six of them with Muslim majorities.

Plaintiffs introduced Trump’s tweets and campaign statements as evidence to show that his intent was to discriminate against Muslims, including his campaign pledge for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”

The U.S. Supreme Court, though it considered the statements relevant, ruled that the travel ban was “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority” and that the issue before it was “not whether to denounce the statements.”

Like the travel ban case, “courts are going to look at the National Emergencies Act itself and how Congress wrote it,” said Turley, adding that it doesn’t have the types of limitations people seem to be intimating. “Congress wrote an act which gave a president virtually unilateral authority to declare a national emergency.”

The Challengers: ‘A policy disagreement is not an emergency — it’s democracy’

Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday: “We will be looking at a national emergency because I don’t think anything’s going to happen. … I don’t think Democrats want border security.”

Groups and individuals challenging Trump’s declaration will argue that emergency powers were meant to be used during a national crisis, when Congress doesn’t have the time to act swiftly enough.

But, they will argue, Trump’s statements belie this principle.

“Trump’s actions are geared at a dissatisfaction with the process. A policy disagreement is not an emergency — it’s democracy,” said Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union National Security Project, which is among the agencies that indicated they will sue if Trump declares a national emergency.

Assuming these litigants can establish their standing to take Trump to court, judges will want to see some support for the claim that an emergency exists. They might or might not be satisfied with sweeping declarations about a “crisis” and claims about terrorism, drugs and crime that have already been proved false or misleading.

Those suing will also try to debunk Trump’s claim of emergency power as “bogus,” said Pat Gallagher, a top attorney at the Sierra Club, an environmental organization that has said it is likely to sue.

Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at law and public policy institute Brennan Center for Justice, said that courts will weigh the evidence that Congress intended the president to have these powers and for this particular purpose. In part, she said, they will consider Trump’s tweets and public statements.

“In a case where motive is relevant, the president may tweet something that is evidence of his intention. In this case, the president’s tweets are very much backed up by his actions,” she said. “The fact that there is a legislative appropriations process suggests that this isn’t an emergency but an effort to circumvent the authority of Congress.”

How will the court challenges turn out?

While courts are supposed to show deference to the president, particularly in matters of “national emergencies,” the challengers have a distinct advantage: They don’t actually need to prove anything to obtain a temporary order. They do not have to “win” the case to block construction of the wall.

In the end, though, a court will divide its review between narrowly considering what conditions were placed on the emergency authority and looking at whether Congress gave the president unchecked authority to declare an emergency and undesignated funds to use.

Even with the president’s statements, Congress did create a virtually unchecked authority for a president to declare a national emergency.

Turley said, “In the end, it’s what Congress has done, not what the president has done, that will be the court’s focus and determine the outcome of this challenge.”

A judge ruled Wednesday that the federal government can begin surveying land for a border wall on property that houses a small Texas church against the wishes of the local Roman Catholic Diocese, setting up a potentially lengthy fight as the church claims a wall would violate its religious freedom.

The ruling came as the Trump administration appears to be moving forward with plans to access private land for a wall it wants to build along the southern border with Mexico; Trump on Tuesday night during his State of the Union address reaffirmed his desire to build a wall to secure the border and more carefully control immigration.

Along this stretch of southern Texas, Customs and Border Protection now says it will take some residents to court to access their private land as the agency determines whether a border wall can be built on the properties. Protesters are camped in tents near a historic cemetery and a butterfly sanctuary that they argue will be disturbed should a wall be built in the area — and they are facing newly placed excavating equipment that appears poised to begin moving dirt as part of a congressionally approved section of the wall that received funding last year.

Landowners here say they are increasingly on edge as they receive letters indicating the government wants their land along the Rio Grande, and they are poised for eminent domain court battles that in the past have lasted a decade or more.

U.S. District Judge Randy Crane ruled that the surveying of the diocese’s property — work that should take just a few hours — does not constitute a “substantial burden” on the religious function of the 170-year-old La Lomita Chapel, which lines the river in the border city of Mission.

[Trump’s wall needs private property. But some Texans won’t give up their land without a fight.]

The diocese owns the chapel grounds but leases it to the city as a park. Bishop Daniel Flores has resisted the government surveys on the grounds that any constructed barrier “violates his religious beliefs,” said Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor representing the diocese. “The Church believes any access violates the sacred nature of the place.”

John Smith, an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Texas who works on property issues related to the border barrier, said in court that the government already has received permission to survey neighboring properties and wants to push forward with the church property as part of the assessment process.

Smith said the church parcel is “the last section we don’t have right of entry” to in the area, which is near the riverfront county park where Trump viewed the Rio Grande during a visit in January. Smith said the federal government has no intention of disrupting religious activities at the chapel once a barrier is built.

The first nearby construction of the new barrier is slated to begin shortly on a levee that cuts through two federal wildlife refuges upstream from the chapel.

As he has in other recent hearings to allow surveyors onto private property, Crane sided with the government. Noting that he visits the chapel, Crane said he “can’t see that allowing a few people on to do some surveying works is a substantial burden. Certainly the government’s entitled to have some survey work done.”

McCord said after the hearing that the church could not, in good conscience, grant access to the surveyors without a court order. The real battle for La Lomita, she said, will come if and when the government moves to take the property.

“This really is just step one,” McCord said.

In January, four Democratic U.S. senators wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, arguing that “eminent domain should not be invoked in violation of any religious organization’s First Amendment right of free exercise of religion, Fifth Amendment right to just compensation for any public taking of private property, or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.”

The proposed wall also would split the National Butterfly Center Refuge in Mission and the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park. The preserves, along with the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge — where Congress has prohibited building a wall — attract naturalists and birding and butterfly enthusiasts, pumping several hundred million dollars a year into the local economy.

On Tuesday, protesters, many of whom identify as members of the Carrizo-Comecrudo, a small indigenous tribe that traces its roots to communities along the Rio Grande that predate Spanish colonization, gathered in tents near a century-old cemetery.

Christopher Basadú said the requirement of a 150-foot perimeter on either side of the wall would mean that the cemetery would have to be removed. Though no indigenous remains are in the cemetery, the activists have made common cause with the local families who stand to lose their ancestors’ burial grounds, he said.

“The construction of the wall will disturb sacred ground,” Basadú, 46, said as he walked amid the gravestones. “These are indigenous homelands. We are not claiming ownership of the property in the legal sense. But this is our ancestral homeland, our sacred responsibility.”

The butterfly sanctuary has threatened to sue if the government attempts to take its land, and the appearance of excavating equipment and trucks near its property this week raised alarms that the government might have been trying to build within the refuge. Instead, the equipment was situated in proximity to federally owned land where construction is slated to begin.

Dozens of landowners across the area received surprise letters from the federal government in recent months, requesting access to their properties for surveys, soil tests, equipment storage and other actions. Lawyers involved in the cases and experts said it is the first of a two-step process the government uses in cases of eminent domain — in which the government tries to seize private land for its purposes. Some landowners already have declined to allow the government on their properties.

Some received a second letter in late January stating that the government plans to serve them with a declaration that would allow it to access their properties for 12 months.

“The Government has an immediate need to enter your property to conduct the necessary surveys,” the letter reads. “Border security tactical infrastructure, such as border walls, lighting and roads, are critical elements to gain effective control of our nation’s borders.”

A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Yvette Gaytan said she gave the government permission to survey on her land, a parcel that is just smaller than an acre, where she lives in a three-bedroom home with her husband, three children and two dogs. Despite her agreement, she said she received one of the government’s demand letters within the past few weeks.

Her family has owned the land for generations. Her teenage children are now terrified that they might have to move. And she is trying to figure out her next steps.

“It’s not big,” she said. “It’s not a palace. It’s my home.”

washingtonpost,‘You call this justice’: No charges against officer who killed black man he mistook for a mall shooter,"['Kristine Phillips', 'Reporter Covering National', 'Breaking News', 'February At Pm', 'Kristine Phillips Covers National', 'Breaking News For The Washington Post. She Previously Covered Criminal Justice', 'Courts', 'Legal Affairs At The Indianapolis Star.']","A police officer who shot and killed a black man during a shootout inside an Alabama mall will not face criminal charges.

A report released by the state’s attorney general’s office says that the officer “reasonably exercised” his power when he shot Emantic “EJ” Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. three times. In the seconds-long chaos of that Thanksgiving night, the officer saw Bradford holding a gun, just feet away from a man who had just been shot. He saw the 21-year-old as “an immediate deadly threat to innocent civilians,” the report says, even though Bradford never fired his gun.

Bradford’s death last November reignited racial tensions in Alabama, where protesters marched through the Riverchase Galleria in the city of Hoover, demanding why police killed a black man who may not have had anything to do with the shooting.

Now, more than two months later, the decision to not charge the officer has renewed that outrage. On Tuesday evening, protesters outside Hoover City Hall burned American flags spray-painted with “BLACK LIVES DON’T MATTER,” as police officers watched from a short distance. Frank Matthews, one of the organizers, told the Associated Press that demonstrators, including Bradford’s relatives, will travel to Montgomery, Ala., on Wednesday to protest outside the office of Attorney General Steve Marshall.

“Today took us by surprise. Some were expecting today’s outcome; some weren’t,” Iva Williams, of the Birmingham Justice League, told reporters Tuesday. “But nevertheless, we stay united in seeking social justice moving forward.”

The 26-page report released on the same day pieced together the rapid sequence of events that began with two gunshots just before 10 p.m. on Nov. 22, during early Black Friday shopping at the Galleria.

Erron Brown, the man who police later said was the actual shooter, allegedly shot 18-year-old Brian Wilson on the mall’s second-floor walkway and left him lying outside a JC Penney store. Brown ran toward the store as mall shoppers scurried away. Bradford, who was nearby, ran in the opposite direction. But he then turned around and headed toward the JC Penney and Wilson, with his gun drawn, the report says.

The officer and his partner, both of the Hoover Police Department, were behind him, just a few feet away. Believing that Bradford was about to kill Wilson, who was already bleeding with gunshot wounds, the officer fired four shots. He struck Bradford in the head, neck and lower back.

But what the officer didn’t see in the immediate chaos was Brown, who shot Wilson just seconds earlier, the report says.

[‘They shot the wrong man!’: Police said they killed a mall shooter — then said they made a mistake]

Witnesses told investigators that they heard the officer tell Bradford to drop his weapon. But the officer told investigators that he was unable to give verbal commands because of the “quickness of the event” and the “immediate threat” he believed Bradford posed, according to the report.

The report says that the officer’s actions were consistent with nationally-accepted standards for active shooter scenarios. That he mistakenly believed Bradford shot the victim “does not render his actions unreasonable,” the report says.

“First, a reasonable person could have assumed that the only person with a gun who was running toward the victim of a shooting that occurred just three seconds earlier fired the shots,” the report says, adding that the other officer and two other witnesses all said that, at that moment, they also believed Bradford was the shooter.

[Opinion: Police killed two good guys with guns. Arming more people isn’t the answer.]

Brown, 20, has been charged with attempted murder. His attorneys said he shot Wilson in self-defense, according to the report, which did not say how the two men knew each other. There has been no evidence that Bradford was involved in the shooting, and it remains unclear why he drew his gun.

The report also did not say whether he knew that the officers were behind him. Although the officer was wearing a body camera, he did not activate it before he shot Bradford. There was “no time” to do so, he told investigators.

Bradford’s parents and a family attorney said earlier that he had a concealed-handgun license. The officer, who was not named, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, though it was not immediately clear if he has been reinstated. The Hoover Police Department have not responded to a request for comment Wednesday.

Outside Hoover City Hall on Tuesday evening, activists vowed to not stay silent. Bradford’s relatives, including his mother, held pictures of him in military uniform. (A spokesman for the Army told The Washington Post last year that Bradford began training but never completed it.)

“You shoot my firstborn son three times, three kill shots and you call this justice. How dare you. If this happened to your child, would you still call it justice? Because I don’t see any justice in this,” Bradford’s mother, April Pipkins, said in front of reporters, her eyes watery.

“He didn’t deserve what you did to him. . . . If you felt like he was a threat, you had to shoot him three times? And you say that the law justifies this? No verbal warning. Shame on you. Shame on you,” Pipkins continued.

Bradford lived just outside of Birmingham, a few miles from the mall. He was one of the nearly 1,000 people who were shot and killed by police in 2018, according to The Post’s database of police shootings, and is now among the many black men whose deaths have led to accusations of systemic racism in U.S. law enforcement.

washingtonpost,Holocaust survivors receive reparations for deportations on French trains,"['Katherine Shaver', 'Reporter Covering Urban Planning', 'Transportation Issues', 'February At Pm']","Holocaust survivor Leo Bretholz was among those who sought reparations from the French government for being deported on a French train during World War II.

More than seven decades after World War II ended, 49 Holocaust survivors are receiving $402,000 each from the French government in reparations for the French trains that deported them to Nazi concentration camps, the State Department said Wednesday.

Thirty-two spouses of deportees who died after the war will receive up to $100,500 each, officials said.

The payments fall under a 2014 U.S.-France agreement in which the French government offered $60 million in reparations for Holocaust deportations. In exchange, the U.S. government asked courts to dismiss any lawsuits against the French railway, known as SNCF, and the French government.

The agreement came after U.S. Holocaust survivors who had been transported to Nazi camps on French trains — usually with no food and a bucket for a toilet — objected when Keolis, a company affiliated with the French railway, began bidding on lucrative U.S. rail contracts. The State Department decided which claims merited payment under the agreement.

“This is a really important moment, a very satisfying moment, and the end of a painstaking process to help those who were long denied justice,” said former ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, the State Department’s expert adviser on Holocaust-era issues.

Greg Schneider, executive vice president of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, said reparations are “important for the historical record” and to hold governments and companies accountable for their roles in the Holocaust.

“Holocaust compensation is never about the money,” said Schneider, whose nonprofit group negotiates for reparations. “It’s about acknowledgment. It’s about recognition. It’s about justice. . . . Is there any amount of money that could compensate you for even one day in Auschwitz, a factory of death and murder?”

The French Holocaust reparations agreement was unique, Eizenstat said, because it included compensation for the heirs, including children and grandchildren, of both deportees and their spouses. The heirs were viewed as “standing in the shoes” of those who had died before the agreement was signed, he said. The heirs will receive a portion of a deportee’s and spouse’s payments, depending on when they died.

The State Department approved 386 of the 867 claims filed, officials said. The agreement covered U.S. citizens, as well as deportees who settled in other countries after the war. It did not cover citizens of France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Poland and the former Czechoslovakia because those countries have their own reparations programs, Eizenstat said.

Most who are receiving payments are Americans or Israelis, officials said, but they include survivors, spouses and heirs from Canada, Mexico, Peru and other countries. They also include eight to 10 U.S. and Canadian airmen who were deported after being shot down over France, officials said.

The total payments will end up being almost double what many recipients initially received during the first round in the summer of 2016, when about $30 million was paid out.

State Department officials said they had made “conservative” payments as quickly as possible because so many of the survivors and their spouses were elderly. The department is now making a second round of payments to those recipients, as well as to applicants who filed successful claims later.

Letters to the recipients announcing the second round of payments were mailed this week, said Jennifer Newstead, the State Department’s legal adviser.

“While no program can provide complete justice for all those who were impacted by deportation from France,” Newstead said, “we hope those affected by one of history’s darkest eras will receive some additional relief from these further payments.”

The State Department rejected 481 claims because they didn’t fall under the agreement, Eizenstat said. Those included claims filed by French citizens who lived in the United States, Holocaust survivors who had been transported within France but never deported, and distant relatives who weren’t considered heirs.

Lisa Grosh, assistant legal adviser on the agreement, said few were rejected for a lack of documentation. She said State Department officials worked with survivors and families to dig up decades-old marriage licenses, death certificates and deportation records.

“We worked very creatively with the claimants . . . to give them ideas about how they could go about giving us the certainty we needed to approve the claim,” Grosh said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/holocaust-survivors-receive-reparations-for-deportations-on-french-trains/2019/02/06/69da6d52-2a23-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00

Before he set out to build a Nazi empire and exterminate Europe’s Jews, Adolf Hitler toiled as an artist on the streets of Vienna, supporting himself by selling hand-painted postcards of city landmarks.

The fascist state that he sculpted no longer exists, and the German criminal code devised after the war sought to erase its traces by banning Nazi iconography, including swastikas. Giving the Hitler salute is punishable by up to three years in prison. Holocaust denial is also verboten.

But Hitler’s creative vision lives on, in the form of sketches and watercolor paintings that bear his name, though some are thought to be forgeries. By his own account in “Mein Kampf,” he created as many as three works a day during his stay in Vienna between 1908 and 1913.

More than 30 pieces signed “Adolf Hitler” or “A. Hitler” will go up for sale Saturday at an auction house in Nuremberg, in southern Germany — part of a trade in Hitler’s creations that some find reprehensible.

The sales are “repulsive and sick,” finds the British art critic Jonathan Jones. In a 2015 column, he asked, “Who are these collectors that fork out considerable sums for the art of a man who caused murder and cruelty beyond imagining?”

The only consolation, he reasoned, is that many of the pieces turn out to be fakes.

A catalogue prepared by Nuremberg’s Auktionshaus Weidler indicates that the “special auction” will include “pictures signed or monogrammed” by the dictator, spanning 1907 to 1936. The items come from private collections in Austria and elsewhere in Europe — from “famous artists of the Third Reich” or their heirs, as well as from the estates of collectors.

The highest starting price is 45,000 euros, or about $51,000, for a landscape of a lakeside village, rendered in light blue and deep green watercolors. The lowest ask is 130 euros, or close to $150, for a study of a small-town monastery. One of the pieces is a nude drawing of Hitler’s half-niece, Geli Raubal, who lived with him in Munich and is thought to have used his gun to kill herself in 1931.

Trade in Hitler’s art is allowed in Germany as long as prohibited symbols do not appear. Still, the transactions rarely escape controversy, particularly in Nuremberg, where the Nazis staged annual rallies and passed a set of laws stripping Jews of citizenship in 1935. After the war, the Bavarian city hosted the war crimes trials that gave rise to the declaration, “Never again.”

Bids for the pieces come from China and the United Arab Emirates, as well as from within Europe, the Nuremberg auction house has said. One of the auctioneers, Kerstin Weidler, defended the works as historical artifacts, denying that buyers were “all old Nazis.”

“Not at all,” she said in a 2016 interview with Germany’s public international broadcaster, Deutsche Welle. “Among the buyers, we have collectors who want to own a piece of world history. There are customers from all over the world, for example a museum in Brazil.”

Weidler said the auction house assesses the authenticity of the works using lighting tests and by comparing the images to a catalogue of Hitler’s material, developed in the 1930s using the main Nazi archive. The credibility of Nazi-era efforts to verify the works stands in question.

It is difficult not to read Hitler’s crimes back into his artwork, though its mundane and mimetic quality resists such interpretation. The prosaic pieces suggest that his ambitions were once starkly different from what he ultimately carried out, observed Deborah Rothschild, who curated a 2002 exhibit on Hitler’s early years at the Williams College Museum of Art in Massachusetts.

“I want to take him down a notch,” she said that summer in an interview about the exhibition. “He’s not an evil genius. He wasn’t born evil. If things had gone his way I think he would have been quite happy to be an academic art professor.”

The works up for auction in Nuremberg range in style but mostly reveal the aspiring artist’s dedication to craftsmanship and precision, and his tendency to imitate simple patterns from mass-market imagery. He particularly admired the Italian Renaissance and early baroque traditions, as well as genre painting.

Others say the art makes the viewer, and especially the collector, complicit in the acts of its maker.

“If looking at a painting can be said to constitute a moment of intimacy with its painter, then collecting art by the unhinged is tantamount to getting into bed with a madman,” a columnist in the Guardian wrote in 2009, after a Hitler trove was sold in Britain for the equivalent of more than $100,000. Those pieces, discovered after the war by a British soldier in Germany, had apparently sat in a collector’s garage ever since.

The Nazi leader isn’t the only abhorrent figure whose artistic inventions elicit curiosity, turning otherwise quotidian images into desired commodities. A clown self-portrait painted in oil by John Wayne Gacy, who assaulted and murdered at least 33 men and boys between 1972 and 1978, recently sold for $7,500 at an upmarket auction in Philadelphia. The prices can be much steeper on entire websites devoted to the trade in serial killer art, featuring works by Charles Manson and Richard Ramirez.

The Nuremberg auction house has established itself as a leading purveyor of Hitler’s work. In 2015, it reaped $450,000 for 14 pieces by the Nazi dictator.

Questions about authenticity have dogged attempts to distribute Hitler’s art. The upcoming auction will come two weeks after German authorities seized three watercolors, set for sale in Berlin, because they suspected that the attribution to Hitler was erroneous.

Other custodians of Hitler’s art have made different decisions about what to do with the material.

The policy of the Bavarian state archive is not to pay for the works but only to accept them as donations. Herbert Weidler, the head of the Nuremberg auction house, has similarly sought to avoid being seen as profiting unduly from the morally dubious artwork. But when he pledged to donate part of the proceeds to a historic preservation society in 2014, according to the Nürnberger Nachrichten newspaper, the group declined to take the money. The preservation nonprofit called the suggestion that it was unconcerned with the source of its funding a “great wonder.”

Four watercolors remain in the hands of the United States government, decades after they were seized by the American Army — and used as evidence at the Nuremberg trials. In 2003, a federal judge in Washington turned back efforts by a Houston-based collector of Nazi memorabilia to claim the works based on an agreement with heirs of Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler’s friend and photographer.

The pieces are locked away at the U.S. Army Center of Military History in Washington, available only to scholars.

Those who want to understand Hitler and the devastation he wrought would be wise to examine the works, advises art historian Birgit Schwarz. More attention has been paid to the despot’s tastes as a collector, to the artistic plunder he oversaw during the Third Reich and to his crusade against modern masterpieces that the Nazis labeled “degenerate art.” Whole exhibitions have been devoted to the denigrated material.

But in Hitler’s own paintings lie clues about his self-conception as a creative mastermind, Schwarz said in a 2009 interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel.

“Hitler’s deluded view of himself as a genius is based on the confused system of thought emerging in the late 19th century, which centered on the idea that a genius — a strong personality who outshone everything else — could do anything and could do anything he pleased,” she said. “His love of art led directly into the heart of evil.”

Twice rejected by the Austrian capital’s Academy of Fine Arts, Hitler continued to see himself as an artistic genius.

As German troops marched on Poland in 1939, the Nazi leader remarked to the British ambassador in Berlin, “I am an artist and not a politician. Once the Polish question is settled, I want to end my life as an artist.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/06/how-much-watercolor-by-hitler-an-auction-house-wants-more-than/,2019-02-06 00:00:00
washingtonpost,"South Korea hails new Trump-Kim summit, hopes for ‘specific’ progress this time","['Simon Denyer', 'Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan', 'North Korea', 'South Korea.', 'Min Joo Kim', 'February At Am']","South Korea welcomed President Trump’s announcement that he will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam on Feb. 27, expressing hope Wednesday that the pair can build off their first meeting to make “more specific and substantial progress” this time.

The presidential Blue House also noted the choice of Vietnam as a venue carries important symbolism, signaling that friendship with the United States is possible after a long period of hostility.

“Vietnam and the United States used to point guns and knives at each other but have now become friends,” presidential spokesman Kim Eui-keum told a news conference Wednesday. “We expect Vietnam to be a perfectly suitable backdrop to a new history to be written between North Korea and the United States.”

In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Trump said his administration was continuing its “historic push for peace in North Korea.” He noted the return of several American citizens who had been imprisoned by the North Korean regime and Pyongyang’s suspension of nuclear and missile tests.

“If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea,” Trump said. “Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. Chairman Kim and I will meet again on Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam.”

Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, called the president’s rhetoric about preventing a war “somewhat exaggerated” but acknowledged Trump’s role in the detente with North Korea.

“The possibility of North Korea waging an actual war had been low even before Trump took office,” he said. “Still, the level of provocation from North Korea had been constantly elevating with nuclear tests and missile launches until last year. It is worth noting that Trump’s decision to talk directly to Kim Jong Un has marked a dramatic turn in North Korea’s attitude.”

Opinion about Trump’s outreach to Kim Jong Un divides North Korea experts.

Some give him credit for opening a dialogue with Kim after years of drift under his predecessor, Barack Obama. But some also criticize him for failing to elicit any concrete pledges about denuclearization when he met the North Korean leader in Singapore last June.

Last month, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Trump and Kim need to move from “abstract” talk to “concrete” action the next time they meet, to speed up their peace process and bridge mistrust.

On Wednesday, the Blue House statement echoed his sentiment.

“The two leaders have already taken the first step toward shaking off the past 70 years of hostility in Singapore,” spokesman Kim Eui-keum said. “We look forward to a more specific and substantial step of progress in Vietnam.”

[U.S. envoy to visit North Korea with plan to restart denuclearization talks]

Moon has invested his personal prestige in the North Korean peace process and is keen to cement much closer economic relations with the North, but he has been stymied by the slower pace of rapprochement between Washington and Pyongyang.

CNN reported this week that the plan was for the summit to take place in the Vietnamese coastal city of Danang, but it later said Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, was also an option.

U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun is due to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Hyok Chol in Pyongyang on Wednesday, as he attempts to push forward preparations for the summit and advance a plan to reinvigorate talks about denuclearization.

Last Thursday, Biegun set out for the first time in a speech at Stanford University how he hopes to move the process forward, taking what several experts described as a more flexible and realistic approach than the administration has adopted thus far.

In particular, he spelled out the Trump administration’s vision of a fundamentally transformed relationship with North Korea, including significant economic engagement, if the country gives up its nuclear arsenal.

But not everyone is convinced the summit will yield meaningful progress.

Van Jackson, a former Pentagon official who now teaches at Victoria University in New Zealand, called it “reality-show entertainment” that is distracting from the real business of diplomacy, with talks between the two sides dominated by summit planning rather than real substance.

“I’m a critic of the summit until it’s connected to a diplomatic process that freezes and rolls back North Korean nukes,” he said. “It could happen, but the past eight months give me no confidence.”

One media report suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping might also travel to Vietnam, and South Korean reporters asked the Blue House on Wednesday if Moon might also attend. But spokesman Kim Eui-keum played down the chances.

“It is contingent on progress of talks between North Korea and the United States, but the possibility is low,” he said.

The North Koreans have been asking for a declaration formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War, an appeal which has won support from the South Korean government and appears to be something to which Trump is prepared to agree.

“President Trump is ready to end this war,” Biegun said last week. “It is over. It is done.”

The Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.

But a declaration to end the war would have to be signed by the leaders of the main protagonists — both Koreas, China and the United States — and experts say time is very short to coordinate such a step by the end of this month.

Japan said it hopes that the agreement Trump and Kim reached last June, including the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, would be implemented “thoroughly and swiftly,” while Australia said it was important to enforce international sanctions against North Korea to show Pyongyang that “the world is equally committed” to its denuclearization.

“It’s not an overnight process. It is a very significant process,” Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. “It will require extensive negotiations with the regime.”

washingtonpost,Danish Jehovah’s Witness sentenced to six years in prison in Russia,"['Anton Troianovski', 'Moscow Bureau Chief Covering Russia', 'February At Am']","A Russian court sentenced a Danish Jehovah’s Witness to six years in prison for extremism Wednesday, one of the harshest verdicts in years against a Western citizen here and the latest incident in Russia’s crackdown on personal freedoms.

The Jehovah’s Witness, Dennis Christensen, was detained in May 2017 after a police raid on his congregation in the city of Orel, south of Moscow, and has been in jail ever since. On Wednesday, the district court ruled he was guilty of “organizing the activity of an extremist organization,” according to the Russian branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

The Russian Supreme Court ruled Jehovah’s Witnesses to be an extremist organization in 2017, ordered its activities banned, and said its property could be seized. Christensen is the first member of the religious group to be sentenced for extremism, said Tanya Lokshina, the Moscow-based associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division.

The ruling comes amid an ongoing crackdown on personal and civil liberties in Russia and sends the message that people’s prominence or foreign citizenship won’t protect them from prosecution.

“Six years in jail for peacefully practicing your own religion is something that comes right out of the history book on Soviet dissent,” Lokshina said. “It sends a very strong signal to all those who are ready to stand up that there will be no mercy.”

Christensen will appeal the decision, the Russian branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses said.

Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said his country would continue to assist Christensen and called on Russia “to respect freedom of religion.” Yaroslav Sivulsky, a representative of the European Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses, said Christensen was punished for “reading the Bible, preaching, and living a moral way of life.”

Russian authorities have described Jehovah’s Witnesses — the group says it has about 170,000 believers in Russia — as a threat to public order. At the Russian Supreme Court, the government brought in former followers to testify that top church officials took “total control” of their “intimate life, education and work.” The Jehovah’s Witnesses’ lawyers have denied those allegations.

Founded in the United States in the 19th century, Jehovah’s Witnesses reject subservience to the state and believe God to be the only true ruler. They do not serve in the military or vote.

Scores of other Jehovah’s Witnesses are in detention around the country, watchdog groups say.

In a meeting with human rights activists in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin described extremism charges against Jehovah’s Witnesses as “nonsense,” leading to speculation that legal pressure on the religion’s believers would soon stop. Wednesday’s ruling, however, shows this is not the case.

[Russia just effectively banned Jehovah’s Witnesses from the country]

Russia’s current crackdown extends beyond religion. It comes as the Kremlin faces growing signs of public discontent amid persistent reports of official corruption and a deeply unpopular government plan to raise the retirement age. Putin’s approval ratings have fallen to their lowest level since before his annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014, which was widely lauded at home. They are still at 64 percent, according to the independent Levada-Center, but well down from earlier levels in the 80s.

Oyub Titiev, head of the human rights organization Memorial’s Chechnya office, has spent more than a year behind bars on drug charges that his lawyers insist are fabricated. In December, Russia detained an American, Paul Whelan, on spy accusations — though officials haven’t said what he was spying on or on whose behalf.

In January, authorities in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don charged activist Anastasia Shevchenko for “repeated participation in the activities of an undesirable organization” — the first time ever that such criminal charges have been filed in Russia, according to Amnesty International. The “undesirable organization” in question is Open Russia, a human rights group founded by exiled former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

The state may now be laying the groundwork for an even more far-reaching crackdown on dissent. A draft law pending in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, would create the groundwork for the Russian Internet to be isolated from the rest of the world.

“We’ve seen very dire developments where freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association are concerned,” Human Rights Watch’s Lokshina said.

washingtonpost,"Italy’s government promised to put ‘Italians first,’ but its policies are hurting Italians, too","['Chico Harlan', 'Rome Bureau Chief Covering Southern Europe', 'Sometimes Parts Beyond', 'Stefano Pitrelli', 'February At Pm']","

This former pension building in Rome has become home for 450 people. (Geraldine H. Ghelli for The Washington Post)

The building is seven stories tall, not far from the main train station, surrounded by cheap motels. Once, it was the bureaucratic headquarters for a government pension fund. Now, it is an illegal home for 450 people who sleep in the old office rooms, share bathroom cleanup duties, and take turns standing guard at the front entrance, ready to press an alarm button if and when authorities show up and order them to leave.

Some of the people in the building are newly arrived immigrants — the targets of a law-and-order clampdown by Italy’s populist government.

Others, though, might have expected support from a government that has promised to put “Italians first.”

“I am an Italian,” said Maurizio Zanga, 62, a laid-off garbage collector who lives on the seventh floor next to a family of Somalis. “But I am not one of the first. I am one of the last.”

If Italy’s government offers a test case of what happens when populists come to power, the threat to clear illegally occupied buildings shows how defend-the-country measures can end up hurting citizens, too.



Maurizio Zanga is among the 30 to 40 percent of squatters in Rome who are Italian. (Geraldine H. Ghelli for The Washington Post)

Interior Minister Matteo Salvini — head of the far-right League party — has said all squatted buildings in Rome will be cleared, “none excluded.” The Salvini decree, as his signature policy is known, is a sweeping security measure passed by the government in November and presented as a tool to push back against migration. It also raises penalties for squatters, no matter their nationality or legal status, who can face steeper fines and up to four years imprisonment.

Last December, when authorities in Rome cleared a particularly ramshackle building, Salvini showed up at the site and streamed a four-hour video of the operation. He posted on Facebook that the squatters were “mostly migrants.” The video footage included an interview with a man who said he was from Gambia and would sleep on the street that night.

“Send them back to Africa,” one poster wrote below.

“Bravo, Matteo,” another said.

But the prevalence of squatters in Rome speaks not only to a five-year influx of people coming from the Middle East and Africa, but also to a generation-long economic stagnation — and the failure of one government after the next to provide a safety net.

With a dearth of public housing, in a city plagued by economic misfortune and mismanagement, between 10,000 and 11,000 people live as squatters in abandoned factories, office buildings and other properties, according to city data.

Fabrizio Nizi, a housing activist, estimates that 30 to 40 percent of the squatters in Rome are Italians. Some lost their jobs before retirement age and couldn’t find new positions. Others have struggled to enter the workforce entirely. Some have applied for public housing, but the city faces a logjam, and new units are not being built.

“People wait up to 10 years for a home,” Nizi said. “You need to wait for somebody to die.”

Rome has not taken an official stance on the squatters, but a city spokesman said that “plenty of the squatted buildings put the safety of their own squatters at risk. The goal is that of offering a dignified alternative.”

Some of the buildings are in dire shape — no windows, trash everywhere. The old pension building, though, more closely resembles a tidy low-income housing complex, albeit one with no heat. The nameplates of old bureaucrats remain posted outside the office rooms. But some of the occupants have decorated their doors with stickers and art. Residents stage theater performances. Handwritten signs provide rules for a “civil coexistence.” The complex is managed by the residents with help from Action, a housing activist group.

Experts say authorities are unlikely to forcibly clear all squatted buildings, as Salvini has promised. Still, Salvini has managed to raise the anxiety everywhere.

“Day and night, my children are suffering just thinking about it,” said Gianfranco Meneghetti, 53, a resident on the seventh floor of the pension building.

Gianfranco was born in Ethiopia but is an Italian citizen. His eldest child, who is 15, sometimes asks what the family would do after eviction.

“There is nothing I can say to reassure him,” Meneghetti said.

Pension building residents said Salvini’s threats have also heightened an us-versus-them mentality. People said they notice changes in people on the outside, or even in themselves. Some of the Italian squatters have begun to grumble about the noise and cooking odors made by families from other countries, or about how Ramadan forces changes to building meeting times, or about how foreigners beat them out for low-paying cleaning and caretaking jobs.



Italian squatter Sabina Aristarco has mixed feelings about migration. (Geraldine H. Ghelli for The Washington Post)

Sabina Aristarco, 53, an Italian who lives on the first floor, said she’d encountered employers who wanted only people from Africa.

“You’d have to put on blinders not to see the problems with migration,” she said.

At the same time, she saw the benefits to migration, too. Her closest friends in the building were non-Italian. Her partner was from Tanzania. She saw how people from all over — those fluent in Italian and those just learning — could bicker but then settle disputes at weekly building meetings.

At those events, it has been Zanga who often played mediator — stepping into others’ arguments with the gruff and avuncular demeanor of the union boss he once was.

He was established in his career with a waste management company when he was told, in January 2016, that he no longer had a job. He asked his wife and son to go to Colombia, his wife’s home country, where they had family to help them. Zanga tried to stay afloat. Unemployment benefits kicked in, but the payments dwindled month by month until they reached zero. By early 2017, he could no longer pay his rent. By mid-2017, authorities were at his door with an eviction notice. He sold a Sony television for about $100 to pay for a moving van. Then, with his last possessions — a bed, a robot vacuum cleaner, artwork portraying a Tibetan bridge that he says helps him relax — he showed up on the seventh floor. He told almost none of his family and friends what was happening to him.

“I had a normal life. Books, furniture,” he said, with money to spend to have pizza nights with friends. “Here, I’ve closed myself off.”

Zanga said that falling to the bottom rung has prompted him to gradually reevaluate his views. Until several years ago, he said, he was a “false Democrat,” somebody whose opinions hadn’t yet been tested by hardship. Sometimes, he curses to himself about some of the foreigners living around him, who tend to be younger and have larger, noisier families.

“I have become a bit of a jerk in here. Sometimes I feel like saying, ‘Go back to your own country,’ ” Zanga said. “And then I think to myself, what . . . are you saying?”

But Zanga still doesn’t grasp the goal of clearing out squatters entirely. If he’s kicked out, where would he go? Under a bridge? Another squatted building? For him, there is no country to return to.

“If we were kicked out tomorrow, you still haven’t solved the problem,” Zanga said. “Without a doubt the [government] is reducing the spaces for humanity. Those with a normal social life are inside the fortress. And those who are poor are on the outside.”

washingtonpost,Diabetics in Britain worry a no-deal Brexit could put their lives at risk,"['Karla Adam', 'London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom', 'William Booth', 'London Bureau Chief', 'February At Am']","Activists in London in August 2018 try to call attention to the dangers of a no-deal Brexit.

Neil Macdougall has had Type 1 diabetes almost as long as he can remember. He wears a pump on his hip, the size of a mobile phone, that drips insulin into his body. It’s as precious and necessary to him as air.

Macdougall says he stays on top of his condition. But he’s worried about what happens after Brexit. Nearly all the insulin in Britain is imported, the bulk of it from Denmark. If Britain crashes out of the European Union in March without a deal for how to manage the withdrawal, drugs that keep him alive could suddenly be hard to get. Without insulin, Macdougall figures, he’d be dead in 48 hours.

“It’s all very well for politicians just sitting in ivory towers saying, ‘We will get through this with a bit of courage and a bit of hope.’ Courage and hope don’t control my blood sugar levels,” said Macdougall, 44, a telecoms engineer who works in Glasgow.

Britain is getting wobbly in the knees as it faces what was once unthinkable: leaving the E.U. with no deal, no transition period, nothing to replace a system that has provided frictionless trade for more than 40 years.

The British newspapers have been a little hysterical, revealing plans, for example, to evacuate the queen from Buckingham Palace in the event of mass riots in London stoked by empty grocery-store shelves.

Hardcore Brexiteers dismiss it all as propaganda generated by “project fear” Europhile campaigners. But just because some fears may be exaggerated doesn’t make others less real. And growing numbers of patients, doctors, pharmacists and hospital administrators are worried about what a “no deal” Brexit could mean for medicines and medical supplies reaching this island nation.

There doesn’t appear to be appetite in Westminster for a cliff-edge Brexit. Parliament last week voted to assert that Britain should not leave the E.U. without a deal. Still, the current legal default position is that the country will exit the bloc on March 29, with or without a deal.

Most analysts agree that a no-deal departure would be disruptive, at least in the short term.

Overnight, Britain would lose its status as part of the E.U.’s single market and customs union, and it would become subject to third-country rules. Trucks carrying food and medicine could face new border checks. The Road Haulage Association, a transport industry body, has warned of “disastrous queues at ports” if Britain doesn’t exit smoothly with a deal.

For those who rely on lifesaving medicines, the thought of roads to and from ports turning into parking lots is distressing.

Like many sectors, health care is deeply integrated across Europe, with sophisticated “just-in-time” supply chains uniting the 28-nation bloc. Up to three-quarters of all the drugs used by Britain’s state-run National Health Services come from or through the E.U.

British officials have issued assurances that if the country were to leave without a deal, patients will continue to receive the drugs they need — even if that requires the government to prioritize medical supplies over food.

“Of course, medicines will be prioritized,” health secretary Matt Hancock told a parliamentary committee. “We have been through detailed, line-by-line analysis of the 12,000 licensed medicines in the U.K. to ensure there is a plan for the continuity for all medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” he added.

As part of its no-deal contingency planning, the government has asked drug companies to stockpile six-weeks worth of medicines on top of their normal supplies. It is looking into chartering planes to fly in medicines and adding capacity to various shipping routes across the English Channel. It has purchased some 5,000 refrigerators for medical storage needs. “I’ve become the largest buyer of fridges in the world,” Hancock told the BBC.

What the government does not want is for individuals to do their own hoarding. Officials have discouraged patients and pharmacists from stockpiling and told doctors not to write extra prescriptions.

“Doing so risks shortages for other patients,” warned Stephen Hammond, Britain’s health minister tasked with Brexit planning. “If everyone does what they are supposed to, we are confident the supply of medicines will continue uninterrupted whatever the Brexit outcome.”

The problem is that public trust is in low supply as people watch their government and a divided, squabbling Parliament struggle to agree on a Brexit deal.

“Fundamentally, we need to go beyond the government saying, ‘Don’t worry, we have a plan, but we can’t really tell you about it,’ ” said Robin Hewings, head of policy at Diabetes UK.

Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at Nuffield Trust, a health-care think tank, assessed that government preparations “would probably prevent . . . really widespread shortages immediately.” Still, he said, “People are probably right to worry.”

“It’s going to be very difficult to 100 percent guarantee that nothing goes wrong in such a chaotic and untested situation,” Dayan said. He noted that beyond testing medical supplies, a no-deal Brexit could contribute to rising medical costs if the pound falls, and could cause personnel shortages at hospitals abandoned by E.U. nurses, and more strain on the health-care system if British retirees living in the E.U. suddenly lose their European health-care benefits and return home for treatment.

Some pharmacists have already reported drug shortages.

“We are on the front line, and we see, on a day-to-day basis, people coming in, quite desperate to get medication,” said Amo Sohal, owner of Kitsons Pharmacy in Worcester, England. Sohal said he has noticed a sudden drop in the availability of anti-inflammatory painkillers and epilepsy medication. “I’ve been told, ‘No, there’s no stock available,’ ” he said.

Sohal attributed the fall in supply, at least in part, to no-deal anxieties. He said he has heard stories of patients and other pharmacies ordering in bulk because “no one really knows what’s going to happen.”

Macdougall, the Type 1-diabetes patient, is among those hoping to have extra medication on hand, just in case. He said he has had trouble filling his usual order of pump parts, though — a supply shortage he suspects has to do with stockpiling by others.

Diabetes has become one of the most high-profile conditions to be highlighted by Brexit jitters, in part because 99 percent of Britain’s insulin is imported, largely from the E.U. It also needs to be refrigerated, so it cannot sit indefinitely in traffic jams.

“People with diabetes feel a visceral sense of fear about losing access to their insulin,” Hewings said. While the physical response varies from person to person, “if someone stopped taking insulin on a Friday, then they would probably need to go to the hospital by Sunday.”

It’s “genuinely bloody terrifying,” said James Patrick, 39, a writer whose 7-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes.

Patrick said he imagined that stockpiling insulin would be pretty much impossible. “Your doctor isn’t going to prescribe you a year’s worth. You can’t just buy it, because it is a controlled substance, and it’s not shelf-stable,” he said.

Some of the major pharmaceutical companies have outlined backup plans. Novo Nordisk, the Danish drug company that makes most of the insulin used in Britain, said it has more than doubled its stock and has reserved special airfreight slots between April and July so that it can fly insulin into Britain as needed.

“It never should have come to this,” said Allen Curtis, 42, a diabetic from Sunderland, England. “Medication should be the one thing that should never ever be affected by whatever is happening.”

He is concerned about diabetics adjusting their diet so they need less insulin. He knows firsthand how important getting the exact dosage of medication can be. By the time he discovered he had diabetes, at age 27, it had advanced to the stage where he was partially blind, forcing him to leave his job. “People are limiting themselves because of the threat of a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “That’s dangerous.”

Ultimately, people will be looking to Britain’s most high-profile diabetic: Prime Minister Theresa May.

After she received a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes, May told Diabetes UK: “It does change your life in that you have to make sure you’ve got the right diet and that you’re managing your blood sugar levels, but, beyond making sure you’ve got that routine, you just get on with other things exactly the same.”

Britons are hoping that remains true after Brexit.

washingtonpost,A Justice Dept. discipline office with limited reach to probe handling of controversial child sex abuse case,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'February At Pm']","The Justice Department office that handles employee discipline has opened an investigation into whether attorneys committed “professional misconduct” in allowing a well-connected millionaire to spend just over a year in jail to resolve allegations that he molested dozens of young girls.

The department revealed the investigation Wednesday in a letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd to Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who has questioned how the department handled its inquiry of financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Epstein’s case had been the subject of an investigation by the Miami Herald, which detailed how then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, now President Trump’s labor secretary, shelved a 53-page indictment that could have put Epstein behind bars for life.

Epstein, who counts among his friends Trump and former president Bill Clinton, assembled a high-powered legal team to address the allegations he faced. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty in 2008 only to state charges of soliciting prostitution. Victims told the Herald they felt betrayed by the arrangement.

The department’s newly announced investigation is likely to be of limited consequence. According to Boyd’s letter, it is being handled by the Office of Professional Responsibility, which explores allegations of employee wrongdoing. The office’s findings, at worst, typically result in employees being fired, and they are not usually made public, though Boyd wrote to Sasse that the office would “share the results with you at the conclusion of its investigation as appropriate.” It is possible, even likely, the investigation could drag on so long that Acosta, already outside the Justice Department, would by then be out of government entirely.

In a statement, Sasse said: “The victims of Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring deserve this investigation — and so do the American people and the members of law enforcement who work to put these kinds of monsters behind bars. Parents should be grateful for the men and women at the DOJ who are committed to transparency and accountability and for the soon-to-be Attorney General who is committed to pursuing justice.”

A representative for Acosta, who did not respond to requests for an interview for the Herald’s investigation, did not immediately return a message seeking comment for this report.

Martin G. Weinberg, an attorney for Epstein, said in a statement that Epstein’s plea was “fairly negotiated by experienced teams of attorneys representing each party.”

“It was anything but a sweetheart deal,” Weinberg said. “And it was carefully and fully reviewed not only by senior prosecutors within the Southern District of Florida Office but also at multiple levels of the Department of Justice in D.C.”

The government, he said, “avoided litigation risks including the risks of an acquittal and Mr. Epstein went to jail, served a period of probation, lived up to each and every obligation under the Agreement, and has fully conformed his conduct to the law for well over 10 years.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-justice-dept-discipline-office-with-limited-reach-to-probe-handling-of-controversial-child-sex-abuse-case/2019/02/06/fbcdd61c-2a56-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
washingtonpost,Pompeo slams Venezuelan president over blocking of humanitarian aid,"['Mariana Zuñiga', 'February At Pm']","Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted Nicolás Maduro Wednesday, accusing the Venezuelan president of blocking the path of humanitarian aid into the impoverished country.

The United States, which has called for Maduro’s ouster and recognized National Assembly head Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has been coordinating with other countries in the region to deliver food and other provisions to Venezuela for the benefit of the people. But on Wednesday, ahead of anticipated aid shipments, a bridge that would have been an entry point into Venezuela from Colombia was blocked by a tanker truck and two shipping containers placed horizontally across its lanes.

“The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid,” Pompeo tweeted. “The U.S. & other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE.”

National security adviser John Bolton also tweeted about Venezuela on Wednesday, saying senior officers with the Venezuelan military — an institution that has been vital to Maduro’s grip on power — could be shielded from financial penalties if they abandon Maduro and recognize “the constitutional government of President Juan Guaidó. If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely.”

The United States and dozens of other countries have refused to recognize Maduro’s presidency because of what was roundly criticized as a fraudulent election last year. Instead, they have backed Guaidó, a relative novice of a politician who has nonetheless rallied tens of thousands of Venezuelans in street protests against Maduro. The Trump administration has also dealt serious financial blows to the government by freezing overseas bank accounts and imposing sanctions on the state-owned oil company, cutting off the most significant revenue flow for that country. Russia, Cuba and China have continued to stand with Maduro.

Stuck in the middle of the geopolitical drama are the people of Venezuela — and the humanitarian aid.

While eager to see Venezuelans receive much-needed help, relief agencies and nongovernmental organizations worry that aid is being politicized and could become a pawn in this and future political brawls.

“Humanitarian action has to be independent of politics, military and other objectives,” Stéphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman, told journalists in New York.

Mario Villarroel, president of the Red Cross in Venezuela, insisted that his organization would not take sides. “When this material is given to us, we go under the criteria of neutrality, impartiality, independence,” he said, referring to humanitarian supplies.

The latest friction appears to have started over the weekend, when Venezuelan military personnel were seen roaming cities along the Colombia-Venezuela border, according to opposition lawmaker Franklyn Duarte. On Tuesday, he said, Venezuelan troops began blocking the Tienditas international bridge, which connects Venezuela and Colombia.

He said it was ironic that rank-and-file members of military — many of whom suffer from the food shortages and hyperinflation ravaging the oil-rich nation — were being called on to block the path of aid into the country.

“We reiterate the call to the national armed forces because we know that those soldiers are in need of food and medicine, too,” he said. “There are many in the military that don’t agree anymore with attacking the people.”

washingtonpost,"U.S. cuts some military assistance to Cameroon, citing allegations of human rights violations","[""Siobhán O'Grady"", 'Worldviews Reporter', 'February At Pm']","The United States is scaling back its security assistance to Cameroon following credible allegations that the Cameroonian military carried out human rights violations in the Central African country, the State Department said Wednesday.

Cameroon is a key U.S. security partner, and about 300 U.S. troops are based there to train and assist the Cameroonian military, including in its fight against extremism in its far northern region. Human rights groups have reported that Cameroonian security forces have targeted civilians, in the far north and in the country’s unstable southwest and northwest regions, where the military is battling English-speaking separatists fighting to create a breakaway nation called Ambazonia.

“We emphasize that it is in Cameroon’s interest to show greater transparency in investigating credible allegations of gross violations of human rights security forces, particularly in the Northwest, Southwest, and Far North Regions,” the State Department said through a spokesman via email Wednesday.

Security cuts will include the “provision of four defender boats and nine armored vehicles, and the upgrade of a Cessna aircraft belonging to the Rapid Intervention Battalion,” or BIR, the department said.

Members of the BIR, an elite force that has received assistance from the United States, have been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses. The Washington Post reported this week that English speakers from Cameroon’s two Anglophone regions said members of the BIR burned down civilians’ homes and executed a pregnant woman. The Cameroonian military denied targeting civilians.

The U.S. aid cuts also include the withdrawal of a U.S. offer for Cameroon’s candidacy in the State Partnership Program, which pairs American states’ National Guards with another country’s armed forces, delivery of certain equipment and helicopter training.

Washington “will not shirk from reducing assistance further if evolving conditions require it,” the State Department said.

In more than a dozen interviews with displaced English speakers in Cameroon, witnesses described to The Post how the Cameroonian military fired indiscriminately at civilians, in some cases driving moderate Cameroonians to begin supporting the separatists. Col. Didier Badjeck, a spokesman for Cameroon’s Defense Ministry, said the allegations of human rights abuses amounted to “propaganda.”

Last summer, Amnesty International released an analysis of two videos that appeared to show Cameroonian security forces executing unarmed people, including children, in the country’s far northern region.

In August, the Cameroonian government claimed it had arrested soldiers in connection with one video and launched an investigation of the other.

On Wednesday, Adotei Akwei, Amnesty’s deputy director for advocacy and government, urged the United States to suspend “all security assistance until the Cameroonian government can show it has not been utilized to commit serious violations of international law and persons responsible have been held accountable.”

washingtonpost,Trump says Islamic State could be deprived of all territory by next week,"['Anne Gearan', 'White House Reporter', 'Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'Karen Deyoung', 'Associate Editor', 'Senior National Security Correspondent', 'February At Pm']","Islamic State militants could be completely stripped of their territorial base as soon as next week, President Trump said Wednesday, as he reiterated that U.S. forces fighting the militants in Syria will withdraw from the country.

Trump did not give an exact timeline for when the troops will depart, but he tied that promise to what he called the territorial defeat of the group also known as ISIS.

“It should be formally announced, sometime probably next week, that we will have 100 percent of the caliphate,” Trump said, referring to the territory in Iraq and Syria controlled by the militants. “But I want to wait for the official word. I don’t want to say it too early.”

Trump addressed diplomats from more than 70 countries meeting at the State Department to discuss how to proceed against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq now that the group’s militants have been pushed out of all but a sliver of the self-proclaimed caliphate they ruled brutally.

The meeting is the coalition’s first get-together since Trump’s sudden announcement on Twitter in December that the Syria mission was over because, he contended, the Islamic State had been defeated and the mandate for the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops had run its course. Officials in his administration immediately tried to walk back the statement, and the Senate rebuked the withdrawal.

Trump on Wednesday listed what he described as military accomplishments against the militants over his two years in office and took credit for reversing the group’s advances.

“Now, you’re always going to have people. They’ll be around. They’re sick. They’re demented. But you’re going to have them, no matter how well we do militarily. You can’t do better than we’ve done militarily,” Trump said. “But you will have people that will be around, and we’ll search them out, and you’ll search them out, and we’ll find them.”

Trump said that “only two years ago,” when he took office, the Islamic State “had a vast amount of territory in Syria and Iraq . . . and it was a mess. It was a lot.”

But with the exception of the city of Mosul, the majority of the populated territory seized by the militants in Iraq in 2014 had been retaken under the Obama administration. In Mosul, operations in the east side of the city were well underway, with western Mosul finally retaken by the summer of 2017.

“One of my very first acts” as president, Trump said, was to ask the Pentagon to “show me a plan to defeat ISIS.” Although he described the resultant strategy as a “new approach,” the plan he adopted largely mirrored the one already underway in Syria. Trump, as he noted in his remarks, accelerated planned operations by broadening the authority of U.S. field commanders on the ground and increasing the level of assistance given to Syrian Kurdish allies.

He campaigned on bringing U.S. forces home from what he called unending wars, calling the Middle East hopeless.

“We look forward to giving our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome back home,” Trump said Wednesday. “Rest assured, we will do what it takes to defeat every ounce and every last person within the ISIS madness and defend our people from radical Islamic terrorism.”

The meeting at the State Department brought together a coalition of allies, many of which are at odds with the United States, or each other, on several issues. Most of the European countries oppose the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which they consider essential to their national security. Turkey and Saudi Arabia disagree over an investigation into the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates are all enforcing an economic blockade on Qatar.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that the Islamic State remains a menace in Syria and Iraq and that the United States will continue to lead efforts to defeat it even after withdrawing troops from Syria.

“The fight is one that we will continue to wage alongside of you,” he said in opening remarks at the meeting on the Islamic State. “The drawdown of American troops is essentially a tactical change. It is not a change in the mission. It does not change the structure, the design or authorities on which the campaign has been based. It simply represents a new stage in an old fight.”

[Trump ties troop withdrawals in Afghanistan to progress in peace talks]

Pompeo played down the impact of the U.S. withdrawal as he urged nations to contribute money to restabilizing territory liberated from the militant group. In Iraq alone, there is a $350 million shortfall of what’s needed to allow the return of the nation’s citizens.

Despite the planned Syria withdrawal, Pompeo said, “Our mission is unwavering, but we need your help to accomplish it.” He asked coalition partners to “seriously and rapidly consider requests that will enable our efforts to continue,” requests he said would come “very soon.” He did not specify what the United States would ask for. In addition to money to pay for stabilization in areas cleared of the Islamic State, the administration has hinted it might request foreign troops from Arab allies.

One option for the Arabs could be to patrol a “safe zone” along Syria’s northeastern border with Turkey that is being negotiated by Washington and Ankara. In a briefing early Wednesday with reporters, a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing diplomacy, said: “I don’t think we’re prepared to comment on what make up an international force in that safe zone because those conversations haven’t been concluded yet.”

Turkey, which has threatened to attack Syrian Kurdish forces that are U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State, has said its military forces would patrol the area, an option that the administration is believed to have rejected.

A joint U.S.-Turkey statement released following talks in Washington on Tuesday makes no mention of safe zones or Kurdish fighters. Asked whether the U.S. withdrawal would go ahead even if those talks fail, the official was noncommittal.

“I think the president’s direction is clear that when the territorial caliphate of ISIS is destroyed, that is the mission of the American troops in northeast Syria, and he will want them to come home,” the official said. “I wouldn’t want to predict failure given the success of our recent discussions with the Turks. So I think we’ll remain optimistic that creating this safe zone is in both of our best interests and that we’ll be able to get there.”

[Senate rebukes Trump’s plan to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, Afghanistan]

Despite the militant group’s massive territorial loss, the U.S. military worries that the Islamic State’s defeat is not final and that the group could rise again in a year or less.

It “remains a potent force of battle-hardened and well-disciplined fighters that could likely resurge in Syria absent continued counterterrorism pressure,” said a report from the Pentagon’s inspector general Monday.

And Gen. Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, warned Tuesday of just such a resurgence.

“The coalition’s hard-won battlefield gains can only be secured by maintaining a vigilant offensive against the now largely dispersed and disaggregated ISIS that retains leaders, fighters, facilitators, resources and the profane ideology that fuels their efforts,” he told a Senate committee.

The senior administration official indicated that Trump’s withdrawal order will not immediately apply to all 2,000 U.S. military forces in Syria. A U.S. garrison in Tanf, in southern Syria on the border with Jordan, “would be the last place that we would withdraw from,” the official said, “and I think that’s something that has not been scheduled; it would be conditions-based.”

Iraq’s top Shiite religious authority added his voice Wednesday to the chorus of criticism of President Trump’s plan to have U.S. troops stationed in Iraq “watch” neighboring Iran, raising fresh concerns that the idea is imperiling the fight against the Islamic State.

Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani broke tradition by commenting directly on Trump’s proposal — a move that is likely to put pressure on Iraq’s leadership to address the U.S. president’s comments, which have rankled both allies and foes.

“Iraq . . . refuses to be a station used to harm any other country,” said Sistani, an extremely influential figure who typically delivers his opinions privately through intermediaries or through a representative during Friday prayer sermons.

Several political factions that are usually at odds, including those backed by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and a coalition representing several Iran-aligned militias, have called for fast-tracking a bill that would recommend severely limiting the number and activity of U.S. forces in Iraq when parliament reconvenes next month.

Any change to the approximately 5,200-strong U.S. military presence in Iraq could have dire consequences for years.

According to a report released this week, the Pentagon has concluded that Iraqi security forces will need “years, if not decades” to be able to fight the Islamic State or any other terrorist threat without American support. Iraqi security forces, including military and police, still require help with complicated intelligence gathering, even basic infantry techniques, the report issued by the Defense Department inspector general found. “The [Iraqi security forces] will likely rely on the Coalition for years to fill [Iraqi security forces] gaps in intelligence capabilities and deficiencies in ‘command and control, leadership, physical resilience, and ability to execute basic minor infantry tactics.’ ""

The sobering reality about the capabilities of Iraq’s security apparatus comes as the Islamic State has been able to stage sustained but low-level attacks in rural areas despite losing all of the territory it once controlled.

After Iraqi forces backed by U.S. airstrikes and American advisers on the ground reclaimed the city of Mosul in 2017, U.S. military officers and diplomats praised the newfound professionalism of the Iraqi security forces. Just three years earlier, the majority of Iraq’s army and police capitulated in the face of the Islamic State blitz. The United States spent $1.6 billion in the two years that followed 2014 collapse to rebuild the Iraqi military into a force capable of reclaiming territory.

The elite, U.S.-trained Counter Terrorism Service has been described by U.S. officials as the most capable fighting force in the entire Middle East. But at approximately 10,000 troops, it is a small fraction of the Iraqi security apparatus.

The inspector general’s report acknowledged improved security in Iraq’s large cities, which has lead to the removal of thousands of security barriers and the limited reopening of Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone to the general public. But the report also identified significant gaps in security presence in rural areas that the Islamic State has exploited.

Most important, however, the report stated that Iraq’s intelligence capabilities were severely hampered by a lack of structure and information sharing between security agencies. U.S. officials have said sustaining Iraq’s victory over extremists would require shifting from combat to counterterrorism work, which relies heavily on intelligence gathering.

The changes needed for Iraq to be able to conduct such operations without coalition support are “unlikely to occur in the near-term” the report says. “For the foreseeable future, the [Iraqi security forces] would have an ‘enduring requirement’ for signals intelligence and ground monitoring of enemy movements provided by the Coalition,” the report states, citing coalition officials.

These concerns, along with the Iraqis’s continuing reliance on American support for holding territory taken back from the Islamic State and for coordinating airstrikes to root out remaining pockets of militants, means “a long-term U.S. military presence will be required to achieve the stated policy goals of securing the 'enduring defeat’ of ISIS and building the capacity of the [Iraqi security forces].”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/worldviews/how-trumps-comments-on-iran-are-imperiling-the-fight-against-isis-in-iraq/2019/02/06/c2501127-e8c9-48c5-8ad4-4abc61d78392_story.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
washingtonpost,How Trump’s State of the Union addressed foreign policy,"[""Research Assistant For The Today'S Worldview Newsletter"", ""Siobhán O'Grady"", 'Worldviews Reporter', 'February At Am']","On Tuesday evening, President Trump repeated his standard foreign policy line during the State of the Union address, saying that he wants to put “America’s interests first.” As usual, that meant strong lines on immigration and trade — and plenty of praise for his own diplomatic efforts over the past year.

[In dissonant State of the Union speech, Trump seeks unity while depicting ruin]

Here’s what Trump said about the biggest foreign policy issues during the speech:

North Korea

Trump announced that his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take place on Feb. 27 and 28 in Danang, Vietnam. He commended his decision to engage with Kim, saying the United States “would be in a major war with North Korea” had he not been elected president.

It’s not clear how effective this second meeting will be. Trump’s summit with Kim in Singapore last June was a show of good faith and diplomacy, but negotiations between the two sides have produced virtually no progress since then.

Still, South Korean officials welcomed Trump’s announcement that he will meet with Kim again, and remarked on the significance of Vietnam as the meeting place.

“Vietnam and the United States used to point guns and knives at each other but have now become friends,” presidential spokesman Kim Eui-keum told journalists on Wednesday. “We expect Vietnam to be a perfectly suitable backdrop to a new history to be written between North Korea and the United States.” He added that South Korea will “look forward to a more specific and substantial step of progress.”

Immigration

Trump stuck to his usual positions on immigration, reiterating his calls to fund his border wall between the United States and Mexico. Migrants who risk their lives to cross the border are part of an “urgent national crisis,” he said.

Trump again warned that “large organized caravans” are on the march toward the United States. He also claimed that the MS-13 gang is operating “in at least 20 different American states” and that his administration is “removing these gang members by the thousands.” The Washington Post’s fact-checkers said this claim was “dubious.”

As The Post’s Aaron Blake reported, Trump didn’t make his calls for a wall as an ultimatum — many in Washington have worried he will shut down the government for a second time this year if wall funding isn’t passed by Congress — but insisted that he will “get it built.” This time, he did away with his once standard line that Mexico will pay for the wall.

Trade policies

The president claimed success in revising “calamitous trade policies” with China, Mexico and Canada.

He praised the tariffs his administration has imposed on China but also commended Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying he has “great respect” for Xi. He also placed blame on past U.S. leaders for the country’s problems with trade and China.

As U.S. and Chinese officials continue trade negotiations, Trump called for “real structural change” that would “protect American jobs.”

The address didn’t elicit any immediate response from Beijing, with the country practically shut down for the Lunar New Year this week. The Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, didn’t cover the speech, and the official Xinhua news agency skipped all mention of China in its wire report on the address.

Trump also slammed the North American Free Trade Agreement, or as he called it, “the catastrophe known as NAFTA.” He urged Congress to pass his preferred replacement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, to “bring back manufacturing jobs.”

Venezuela

On Venezuela, Trump emphasized his support for Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader whom the United States and many other countries have recognized as Venezuela’s interim president.

“We stand with the Venezuelan people and their noble quest for freedom,” Trump said. He then took aim at Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s socialist policies, saying they turned the state into one of “abject poverty and despair.”

In a somewhat unexpected move, he compared Maduro’s authoritarian socialism to democratic socialists in the United States. He said we was alarmed by what he said were new calls to adopt socialism in the United States, adding, “America will never be a socialist country.”

Syria and Afghanistan

Trump took credit for the ongoing talks between American and Taliban representatives, saying that he “accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan.” The two sides recently agreed to the broad outlines of a deal in which U.S. forces would leave the country in return for guarantees that Afghanistan would not harbor terrorists.

The progress, Trump said, would allow the United States to reduce its presence in Afghanistan, where around 14,000 U.S. troops are stationed. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he said.

Many experts raised the alarm late last year when Trump ordered the Pentagon to cut the number of troops in Afghanistan in half, worrying that Washington might leave a power vacuum that the Taliban will fill.

Trump also called for the withdrawal of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, saying that “it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.”

washingtonpost,European leader Donald Tusk warns there’s a ‘special place in hell’ for Brexiteers who don’t know what they’re doing,"['William Booth', 'London Bureau Chief', 'February At Am']","LONDON — Good for Donald Tusk. Just when Brexit renegotiations were getting a bit dull, the president of the European Council livened things up by suggesting there was “a special place in hell” for “those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it safely.”

That got everyone’s attention, especially in London.

I've been wondering what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted #Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely. — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) February 6, 2019

Tusk was speaking at a news conference in Brussels following a morning meeting with the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. The two were discussing how to preserve an open border in Ireland after Britain leaves the European Union on March 29.

Brexit is in trouble, as the British Parliament, in a crushing humiliation, voted down the deal struck between Prime Minister Theresa May and her European counterparts.

Now May is headed back to Brussels on Thursday to ask the Europeans to help her get the deal through Parliament by changing what is called the Irish backstop, an insurance policy agreed by both sides that would keep the border open between Northern Ireland (part of the United Kingdom) and Ireland (part of the E.U.).

In the news conference, Tusk said he was trying to forge ahead with the British but also warned that European leaders were preparing for the “possible fiasco” of a no-deal Brexit.

Britain is hurtling toward crashing out of the European Union in 51 days with no deal — and no trade agreements, no transition period. This could cause serious economic havoc.

The Europeans have hoped that Britain would, could, might ultimately decide not to divorce, but reconcile. Tusk has stressed that in the past. But on Wednesday, he seemed ready to move on.

“I have always been with you with all my heart, but the facts are unmistakable,” Tusk said. “At the moment the pro-Brexit stance of the U.K. prime minister and the leader of the opposition rules out this question. Today there is no political force and no effective leadership for remain.”

But Tusk was firm when it came to protecting the Good Friday peace accord, which ended 30 years of sectarian violence in Ireland and relies on an open border to ease tensions and bolster good will.

“There is no room for speculation here. The E.U. is first and foremost a peace project. We will not gamble with peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation,” Tusk said.

Regarding the special place in hell line, a representative for the British prime minister told reporters, “I think it is a question for Donald Tusk as to whether he considers the use of that kind of language to be helpful.”

As the news conference in Brussels was winding down, Varadkar was picked up by a hot mic telling Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble, the British, for this.” It was unclear whether he meant his words or his negotiating position.

No matter, Tusk and Varadkar both laughed.

Reaction, as they say, was swift and furious from the Brexiteers.

The Brexit chief for Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, Sammy Wilson, branded Tusk a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac.”

Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, whose rise was partly responsible for convincing former prime minister David Cameron to stage the June 2016 Brexit referendum, replied that Tusk was an arrogant bully and his version of hell sounded like heaven to him.

After Brexit we will be free of unelected, arrogant bullies like you and run our own country.



Sounds more like heaven to me. https://t.co/pTOEmKWJpn — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 6, 2019

While some were pushing back at Tusk, others believed his remarks — and the impasse they represent — shine a poor light on May, who can’t seem to close this deal.

The former No. 2 at 10 Downing, George Osborne, now a newspaper editor, tweeted, “negotiations going well then ...”

The British political press labeled Tusk’s remarks incendiary.

But it was not the first time the Europeans have complained about Brexit.

Tusk has dropped provocative lines before. In January, he hinted about the possibility of Britain staying in the E.U., tweeting: “If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?”

In the months following the Brexit vote, the European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, blamed Brexit on “40 years of lies” by British politicians.

French President Emmanuel Macron once said Brexit was “a choice pushed by those who predicted easy solutions . . . they are liars, they left the next day so they didn’t have to manage it.”

For weeks, they have been begging May to tell them — exactly — what she wants amended in the withdrawal agreement, so that it can pass her divided House of Commons. May, publicly, has said she needs “alternative arrangements” to protect an open Irish border that does not involve keeping Britain trapped in an E.U. customs regime forever. Some have suggested new technologies might come to the rescue.

Talks, such as they are, continue.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/worldviews/european-leader-donald-tusk-warns-theres-a-special-place-in-hell-for-brexit-backers-who-dont-know-what-theyre-doing/2019/02/06/bb1b9559-7781-4e9c-a7d0-233f367488bb_story.html,2019-02-06 00:00:00
washingtonpost,A Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam would carry major symbolism for North Korea,"['Adam Taylor', 'Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects', 'February At Am']","This story has been updated

The first summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump took place in an auspicious location: Singapore.

It wasn’t hard to see why. In the latter part of the 20th century, Singapore underwent rapid economic development, transforming from poor country into a first-world nation — all under the leadership of authoritarian leader Lee Kuan Yew. Kim, who hopes for a similar rate of development while retaining tight political control, was visibly dazzled by the glistening megacity.

Now, a second summit is tentatively scheduled to take place in Vietnam on Feb. 27 and 28. This second location may carry a lot of symbolic weight. It shares much of the appeal that Singapore may have for North Korean leaders — though for the United States, the history may be somewhat awkward.

In practical matters, Vietnam is an obvious choice. It is relatively close to North Korea, for example, which means that Kim can get there without the need for a layover or borrowing a plane that can travel long distances. It is also nonaligned and has diplomatic relations with both Pyongyang and Washington, making it convenient to host their leaders.

And, like Singapore, the country has a tale for North Korea to tell: how a communist-run country wrought the economic rewards of going from an avowed enemy of the United States to a friendly partner.

Both Vietnam and North Korea have the legacy of a brutal Cold War conflict against U.S.-led forces. From the 1950s until 1975, Vietnam and the United States fought in a war in which 58,000 U.S. service members and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese civilians were killed.

Just two decades later, however, the two countries normalized their relations. In 2000, President Bill Clinton became the first U.S. head of state to visit the country since the war; 15 years later, President Barack Obama welcomed Nguyen Phu Trong to the White House, making him the first Vietnamese Communist Party leader to visit the Oval Office. Polls show surprisingly warm levels of trust between the nations.

The city of Danang, one mooted location for the Trump-Kim summit, was a hub for the U.S. military and its South Vietnamese allies during the Vietnam War, before falling to communist forces in March 1975. Now, it is an economic hub for central Vietnam, enticing millions of foreign tourists each year to its sandy beaches, luxury hotels and — perhaps no coincidence, given the current U.S. president — numerous golf courses.

Much of the change in Vietnam can be attributed to its Doi Moi (renovation) policy of economic reforms put in place in 1986. These measures aimed to create a “socialist-oriented market economy” and led to a boom in private industry, resulting in a growing export-led economy while keeping the Communist Party in power.

Indeed, Kim is probably hoping for a similar trajectory — although, presumably, a little quicker. And there he may be in luck, as Vietnamese officials seem to be willing to help him out. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho visited Vietnam late last year, in part to study the Doi Moi reforms.

While visiting the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi last July, Pompeo suggested that North Korea needed to follow in the steps of Vietnam.

“In light of the once-unimaginable prosperity and partnership we have with Vietnam today, I have a message for Chairman Kim Jong Un,” Pompeo said. “President Trump believes your country can replicate this path. It’s yours if you’ll seize the moment. The miracle could be yours; it can be your miracle in North Korea as well.”

Not everyone is convinced that Vietnam provides a clear model for North Korea. Observers of the two countries note that while Vietnam is not a democracy, it is not led by a single strongman, either. Run by a sometimes contentious elite, the country has no real cults of personality — a potential problem for a third-generation dynasty autocrat like Kim.

For North Korea, the division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II also presents unique economic issues. “Opening up to South Korean and foreign capital will bring more normal North Koreans in its factories up to speed on just how backward their country is compared to the allegedly semi-colonial South,” Peter Ward, a columnist at NK News, wrote last year.

Still, it’s easy to see why the Vietnam model would be appealing to Kim. The country is more comparable to North Korea than Singapore in terms of scale and history; it doesn’t come with the baggage that most other major nations in the region would have if they were to host North Korea.

And moreover, Vietnam is one of the few nations on earth that can justifiably say it defeated the United States in a war. Even if North Korea ultimately makes amends with the United States and rejoins the international community, modeling its reform on Vietnam will allow the Kim dynasty to claim something it has wanted for decades: victory.

Press freedom advocates have criticized the government of French President Emmanuel Macron for attempting a warrantless search of an investigative news outlet days after it published material potentially damaging to Macron.

Representatives of the Paris prosecutor, along with police officers, arrived Monday morning at the headquarters of Mediapart alleging that the news organization’s reporting had violated the privacy of a former Macron aide.

Mediapart refused the search on the grounds that the officers did not have a warrant, and it complained that the attempt was a politically motivated effort to uncover its sources.

“This raid is at once illegal and violent,” Mediapart editor Edwy Plenel said in an interview. “It’s an abuse of power, which violates the liberty of the press.”

The Paris prosecutor is an executive appointee and ultimately answers to the president. Macron picked the new prosecutor, Rémy Heitz, in October.

Heitz’s office did not respond to request for comment. The Elysee Palace declined to comment on “an ongoing investigation.”

Advocates of independent media offered their support. “It is vital for a free press that journalists be able to protect confidential sources,” Robert Mahoney, the deputy executive director of Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement. “Public prosecutors have no business poking around in newsrooms.”

Christophe Deloire, secretary general of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, tweeted: “Such an attempt to undermine sources’ secrecy by prosecutors accompanied by police officers is an unacceptable pressure on investigative journalism. Stop violations of freedom of the press!”

Mediapart last week published the results of a multi-month investigation into the “Benalla affair” — a political controversy that has been a recurring problem for Macron.

Alexandre Benalla, one of the president’s confidants and bodyguards, was caught on camera in May beating two labor protesters while impersonating a police officer.

Macron didn’t fire Benalla until the summer, after the controversy erupted, and explanations from the Elysee Palace shifted considerably, prompting a parliamentary inquiry into a possible coverup. Macron’s government survived two separate votes of no confidence in July, but the Benalla episode dealt a devastating blow to Macron’s approval ratings, which have yet to fully recover.

The Mediapart report brought new headaches for the president in the form of previously undisclosed recordings purportedly of Benalla and Vincent Crase, a former head of security for Macron’s party, La République en Marche.

“So the ‘boss’ is supporting us?” the man identified as Crase asks on the tape.

“Ah, well, he’s doing more than supporting us,” the person identified as Benalla replies. “He’s like a madman. [. . . ] And he said just like that, he said, he told me, ‘You’re going to eat them alive. You’re stronger than them.’ ”

In Mediapart’s telling, this was further evidence of a coverup by Macron.

“He’s been covering for Benalla from the beginning, it’s very simple,” Plenel told The Washington Post. “He’s protecting him.”

The Mediapart investigation further suggested that Benalla and Crase violated judicial orders by meeting after they were formally placed under investigation. The investigation also reported that Benalla was “personally involved” during his time at the Elysee with the negotiation of a security contract with a Russian oligarch linked to Vladimir Putin.

The confrontation between Mediapart and prosecutors brought to a boiling point long-simmering tensions between the media and the Macron administration.

The French president has given few news conferences and has granted interviews only rarely. He moved the press room out of the Elysee Palace. He accused the media of not looking for the truth in the Benalla affair, and he signed a law against fake news — a move many journalists decried as dangerous for free speech.

The relationship between the media and those in power in France is complicated, though. Journalists often allow government and nongovernment sources to review quotes before publication, and newspapers and magazines accept hundreds of millions of euros in government subsidies every year. (Digital-only Mediapart is funded by subscriptions.)

“They can criticize the government, of course, but there is still a space of complicity with the institutions,” said Daniel Schneidermann, a French media analyst and a columnist for Libération. “The French press respect French institutions. They can be very violent against a particular government or law, etcetera, but there is a general accord with the institutions.”

Le Monde editor Jérôme Fenoglio dismissed concerns about state support — which has existed in various forms, on and off, for centuries and, in its postwar iteration, stems from the idea that a healthy democracy should encourage a diversity of opinion.

Most government subsidies today come in the form of discounted postal rates for distributing print copies to subscribers, Fenoglio said. Le Monde also received 2.6 million euros, about $2.9 million, in direct aid in 2016, a stipend used for digital development, among other things.

“I know that seen from overseas, this can seem a little strange,” Fenoglio said. “It’s a French particularity. But to say it’s a threat to the liberty of the press? . . . It has no impact whatsoever on the right to inform.”

It was Le Monde that broke the Benalla story last July.

Macron perhaps assumed too much complicity when last week he suggested to a small coterie of journalists invited for coffee at the Elysee that the state “finance structures that assure neutrality.” He was widely condemned by French media.

“It’s a little sad,” Fenoglio said. “This kind of false vision of journalism at the head of state.”

washingtonpost,Pope Francis confirms Catholic clergy members abused nuns,"['Max J. Rosenthal', 'Assignment Editor For The Worldviews Blog', 'Michelle Boorstein', 'Religion Reporter', 'February At Am']","Pope Francis has acknowledged that members of the Catholic clergy abused nuns, adding to a string of recent allegations about widespread sexual abuse by priests and coverups by the church hierarchy.

“It’s not that everyone does this, but there have been priests and bishops who have,” Francis told reporters aboard the papal plane on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. The wire service and other outlets had reported on allegations of nun abuse over the past year, but the pontiff had not confirmed that such abuse took place.

Francis is due to host a gathering of bishops and cardinals in two weeks to address the broader global issue of clergy sexual abuse — including, largely for the first time, adult victims and accountability for those at the top of the church who mismanage and cover it up.

The Washington Post’s Stefano Pitrelli and Chico Harlan wrote in September, when the meeting was announced, that the gathering “is believed to be unprecedented, indicating that the church recognizes that clergy sex abuse is a global problem — even in countries where the church maintains strong social power and cases have not come to light in great numbers.”

“The Church’s credibility has been seriously undercut and diminished by these sins and crimes, but even more by the efforts made to deny or conceal them,” Francis wrote in a letter to U.S. bishops last month. “This has led to a growing sense of uncertainty, distrust and vulnerability among the faithful.”

Asked Tuesday whether he would take a similarly broad approach to tackling the abuse of nuns, Francis signaled that he would. “Should we do something more? Yes. Is there the will? Yes. But it’s a path that we have already begun,” he said, the AP reported.

Speaking about the progress the church has made on the issue, Francis referred to the offshoot French religious congregation that had been dissolved by Pope Benedict XVI after a founding priest had violated chastity vows with women in the order. On the plane, Francis said that some women had been pushed by the priest into “sexual slavery.” But the Vatican on Wednesday clarified that remark, saying that Francis was referring instead to manipulation and the abuse of power.

Francis has been criticized in the past for his handling of the topic. In January 2018, he dismissed accusations that Chilean bishop Juan Barros had covered up sexual abuse committed by a priest named Fernando Karadima. “There is not one shred of proof against him. It’s all calumny. Is that clear?” the pope said at the time. He later apologized and dispatched investigators to Chile but did not condemn Barros.

Some have also criticized what they consider a slow Vatican response to major sexual abuse scandals that broke in other countries, including Australia and the United States.

“The church remains quiet about its investigations and disciplinary procedures,” Harlan reported last year. “It does not release any data on the inquiries it has carried out. A proposed tribunal for judging bishops accused of negligence or coverup was quashed by the Vatican department that was supposed to help implement it. And, rather than being fired and publicly admonished, offending church leaders are typically allowed to resign without explanation.”

A few high-profile allegations against top Catholic clerics by nuns have gained attention in the past year, with some Catholics calling it a #MeToo moment for religious sisters.

Last fall, Indian nuns in the state of Kerala made news by marching with placards, demanding action against a bishop they say raped a nun between 2014 and 2016. After reportedly getting no response from the church to her complaint, she went to police in June — a radical move in the state.

“There are many nuns within the church who are suffering. They are afraid to come out. The church mechanism is a very large and powerful one,” Indulekha Joseph, a lawyer who was helping the women, told The Post last year. “The other problem is once a nun speaks, she is thrown out of the convent and may find herself on the street, because often her family is not willing to accommodate her. A campaign of character assassination starts. The nun will be portrayed as a prostitute.”

Last month, a Vatican official who handles sexual abuse cases for the church quit after being accused of sexual abuse by a former nun. The woman, Doris Wagner, last year accused an unnamed priest of making sexual advances on her while in a confessional. She later identified the priest as Hermann Geissler, who was chief of staff of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a body that handles discipline in sexual abuse cases within the Catholic Church.

Geissler has maintained his innocence but said he was resigning to protect the church.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pope-francis-confirms-catholic-clergy-members-abused-nuns/2019/02/05/dcca89f3-d5f6-47d9-9e35-256794b249d9_story.html,2019-02-05 00:00:00

Herman Zeitchik, Trump said: “Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.”

While foreign viewers of Trump’s address most likely agreed that the world would look very different had the United States not fought in World War II, many also felt obliged to remind the president that they think he is destroying the very world order the Allied victory helped create.

Here are three examples:

Trade wars

What Trump said during his speech: “To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.”

How the United States helped avoid trade wars post-World War II: After the war, the United States was a driving force behind the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1948. Its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), was founded in 1995. Both organizations share the same original goal of creating a “strong and prosperous international trading system, thereby contributing to unprecedented global economic growth” and ultimately fostering “peace and stability,” according to the WTO’s mission statement.

The move was in part a response to the infamous “beggar-thy-neighbor” economic policies adopted by the major economies during the Great Depression in the 1930s, which used tariffs to keep out imports and ended up damaging world trade.

Critics say the WTO and the open-markets approach it pursues have resulted in a deterioration of living conditions for some by increasing economic inequality. But the mounting concerns over Brexit — which are partially rooted in the fact that Britain could lose its free-market access to Europe — indicate just how much frictionless trade has contributed to global economic growth over the past few decades.

How Trump is dismantling it: Trump has shown little enthusiasm for the WTO and other international financial institutions. He has launched a trade dispute with China, threatened to levy tariffs on European products and essentially dismantled a European-U.S. free-trade agreement.

His critics fear that those disputes could still have longer-term repercussions. Whenever trade disagreements arose in the past, the WTO worked to resolve them. Supporters of the WTO argue that Trump has undermined the legitimacy of this process by citing “national security” concerns to justify his tariffs against China. That’s the one case in which the WTO cannot intervene, according to its own rules. Previously, nations had considered resorting to “national security” justifications a no-go, as it could render the WTO mechanisms meaningless if all countries felt comfortable using that rationale.

In the short run, Trump’s strategy could help him win the trade war with China. In the long run, however, it could tear apart the mechanism that kept global trade afloat for decades and were set up by his predecessors for exactly that reason.

Taking into account allies

What Trump said during his speech: “Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.”

“… To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.”

“… Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.”

How the United States took into account its allies after World War II: Two years after the beginning of war, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Canada created the Five Eyes alliance to work closely on security issues and exchange classified information. In addition to that, the United States helped create NATO after the end of World War II, in 1949.

How Trump is dismantling it: Since Trump has taken office, allies within both defense- and security-related alliances have raised the alarm over Trump’s foreign-policy experiments. His announced withdrawal from Syria was harshly criticized by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has vowed to keep French troops in the country to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group. Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal triggered similar condemnations from across Europe, where the decision is viewed as a move toward a possible military escalation. On North Korea, Trump’s bromance with dictator Kim Jong Un was met with confusion in allied capitals around the world, where intelligence agencies agree with their U.S. counterparts that the Kim regime remains a nuclear threat.

Trump has also rarely missed an opportunity to point out other NATO members’ shortcomings in defense spending and at points even raised doubts over the future of the alliance. So far, he has not escalated those threats, but his remarks have lingered over almost all joint exercises and meetings of NATO.

Immigration

What Trump said during his speech: “Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel.”

How the United States helped build the post-World War II refugee resettlement mechanisms: When the United Nations was founded in 1945, the organization was supposed to represent the world, but with the United States being the biggest financial contributor, in many ways it was also set up to fit U.S. interests. The U.N. Refugee Agency, which was created five years later, distributes asylum seekers that meet its refugee criteria among countries around the world. Ultimately, the mechanisms that help mothers, fathers and their children escape war or disaster rely on the goodwill of U.N. member states.

How Trump is dismantling it: During his speech, Trump didn’t use the word “refugee” even once. He repeatedly referred to “illegal immigrants,” meaning migrants from Mexico and other countries in the Americas, to make his point that a wall or physical barrier is still needed on the southern border.

But while Trump didn’t mention refugees explicitly, his attacks on prior administrations’ immigration approach has also affected the United States' long leadership in the resettlement of asylum seekers who meet the U.N. refugee criteria. Trump’s ban on entry to the United States by citizens of several majority-Muslim countries set the tone in 2017, even though the policy was later suspended. But the Trump administration has also set a record-low limit for the number of refugees resettled in the United States annually. Those who are excluded remain at risk near war zones around the world.

To right-wing leaders elsewhere in the world who are opposed to higher refugee intakes, Trump’s moves have come as a welcome justification of their own policies.

To those who stick to the U.S.-driven postwar order, the president’s words seemed an open affront.

President Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday night zigzagged between paeans to unity and sops to his hardcore base. He eulogized World War II soldiers and then wheeled on immigrants and leftist rivals at home. But absent amid the nativist demagoguery and partisan jockeying was any reference to the threat looming above all others: climate change.

That’s no surprise. Trump is an avowed climate skeptic who casts environmentalist efforts as challenges to American sovereignty, not ways to stave off a planet-wide disaster. As much of the United States endured a deep freeze last month, Trump took to Twitter to plead for more “global warming.”

In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2019

Experts quickly noted that the president was confusing weather with climate — and that the warming of the Arctic could lead to sharper, snowier cold spells in the North American winter.

“Only with an ill-informed citizenry could you plausibly dismiss the consensus of the world’s scientists based upon a single cold spell,” wrote climate scientist Michael E. Mann. “Trump and, more to the point, the fossil fuel interests whose bidding he is doing have weaponized the public’s poor understanding of science.”

Trump is certainly at odds with the global scientific community — including leading scientists in the United States and even in his own government. In November, the Trump administration tried to bury the terrifying findings of its own National Climate Assessment by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving. In that report, researchers affiliated with a number of federal agencies offered alarming conclusions about the increased risk of natural catastrophes because of the changing climate.

The U.S. assessment landed just a few weeks after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its own stark warning. The global scientific body wrote that humanity has barely more than a decade to slash carbon emissions on an unprecedented scale to avoid calamity. “Absent aggressive action, many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040,” the New York Times wrote in October.

Now, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, Trump’s climate denial is being thrown in his face. Democrats will hold the first House hearing on climate change in six years on Wednesday. And at the State of the Union itself, they brought in a host of academics and activists focused on the climate as their guests.

“The climate-themed invitees run the gamut, from longtime climate activist Bill McKibben, who was invited by Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), to relative newcomers such as Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, who got a seat from Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.),” noted Dino Grandoni of The Washington Post’s Energy 202 newsletter.

“Instead of tackling the problem head-on, President Trump is burying his head in the sand and handing out favors to his friends in the coal industry,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who invited University of Washington climate scientist Lisa Graumlich as her guest, said in a statement.

For some, there’s no time left to debate with climate change deniers. While the United States shivered, Australia experienced its hottest January on record, a volatile period that saw vast wildfires in Tasmania, epic floods in the country’s northeast that brought crocodiles into town streets and searing heat and drought that led to the mass deaths of fish in parched rivers.

Experts in Australia warned that whole swaths of the country’s coastline could become uninsurable. For right-wing Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who came to office thanks in part to a party revolt against his predecessor’s climate activism, it presents an intensifying political headache.

“It’s extremely inconvenient for any government that does not have a cogent answer for what they’ll do about climate change, to see the effects of climate change putting more and more people and homes at risk,” said Greg Mullins, a decorated former Australian fire chief, to the Sydney Morning Herald. He added that fire seasons “are longer, more severe” and that blazes are “much harder to put out.” This seems also true in California, beset by increasingly devastating wildfires each year.

The extreme weather being experienced in Australia right now is a worrying glimpse of what #climatechange means. Hottest January on record; worst monsoon flooding in a century. These impacts slam people, the environment, and the economy. #climate pic.twitter.com/W4Ysnv1pm1 — Peter Gleick (@PeterGleick) February 4, 2019

On top of the extreme weather, two staggering new studies added to the sense of impending doom. Researchers discovered an “enormous void” under a major Antarctic glacier, a hole amounting to some 14 billion tons of ice that have disappeared within the past three years.

Experts now fear that the melting of Antarctic ice is occurring at a scale and pace previously not imagined. If this particular glacier collapses — something that could happen anywhere between 50 and 100 years from now — sea levels would rise by about two feet across the globe. That’s enough to radically affect life in myriad coastal towns and cities.

A separate study involving more than 350 scientists and policymakers from 22 countries estimated that at least a third of the huge ice fields in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush mountain ranges will be gone by the end of this century — and that’s even if the most ambitious emissions targets are met by countries around the world. The Asian mountain ranges’ vast glaciers have been known as the “Third Pole” and are the major source of drinking water for close to 2 billion people.

“This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” Philippus Wester, a water and climate scientist at the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, said in a statement. “Global warming is on track to transform the frigid, glacier-covered mountain peaks … to bare rocks in a little less than a century.”

For Trump, that may be a timeline of no consequence to his political career. But his inaction and indifference is already part of a broader political legacy likely to be remembered in decades to come.

washingtonpost,New Mexico governor withdraws most National Guard troops from southern border,"['Robert Moore', 'February At Pm']","U.S. Border Patrol agents check for footprints near a border fence at the U.S.-Mexico border at sunset in Antelope Wells, N.M., on Jan. 30, 2019.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday night ordered the state’s National Guard to withdraw most of its troops assigned to the southern border, rejecting the contention that “an overwhelming national security crisis” exists.

Lujan Grisham, a Democrat who took office last month after serving six years in the U.S. House, made the announcement shortly before President Trump’s State of the Union address, in which he spoke of a “tremendous onslaught” at the southern border.

Lujan Grisham said she would keep some New Mexico Guardsmen in the southwest corner of the state, which has seen a huge influx of Central American families in recent months. But she said she rejected “the federal contention that there exists an overwhelming national security crisis at the southern border, along which are some of the safest communities in the country.”

“New Mexico will not take part in the president’s charade of border fearmongering by misusing our diligent National Guard troops,” she added.

In addition to pulling her state’s National Guard forces back from the border, Lujan Grisham also asked that Guard troops assigned to New Mexico from Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Wisconsin leave immediately. A statement said 118 total National Guard troops are deployed in New Mexico as part of a border mission ordered last April by Trump.

A spokeswoman for the governor said 11 to 15 Guard troops would remain in the southwestern part of the state, which has become a popular destination in recent months for smugglers bringing large groups of migrant families to the border. More than 300 people have entered the country at a time at the remote crossing in Antelope Wells, N.M., immediately surrendering to Border Patrol agents.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials last week credited a National Guard helicopter crew with helping to seize about 136 pounds of marijuana, leading to the arrest of four men allegedly smuggling the drug across the border in a remote area of southwestern New Mexico.

In April 2018, then-New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, ordered about 80 Guard troops to the border in response to Trump’s decision to deploy the Guard to the border. Several other governors sent units from their states.

Lujan Grisham, then the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, called on Martinez to cancel the deployment in June as the Trump administration ramped up its “zero tolerance” border enforcement policy, separating thousands of migrant children from their parents. Five other governors — including Republicans in Massachusetts and Maryland — canceled their Guard missions to protest family separations, but the New Mexico Guard continued its deployment.

In his speech, Trump also said he was ordering 3,750 additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. Thousands of active-duty troops were deployed last fall as a caravan of Central American migrants made its way north through Mexico.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-mexico-governor-withdraws-most-national-guard-from-states-southern-border/2019/02/05/8aec65ee-29ac-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html,2019-02-05 00:00:00
washingtonpost,Trump ties troop withdrawals in Afghanistan to progress in peace talks,"['Karen Deyoung', 'Associate Editor', 'Senior National Security Correspondent', 'February At Pm']","The United States will reduce its 14,000-troop presence in Afghanistan as progress is made in negotiations toward a peaceful settlement of the 17-year war, President Trump told the nation Tuesday night, in an apparent loosening of orders he gave the Pentagon in late December to cut the number in half.

In his State of the Union address, Trump also refrained from giving a definitive date for withdrawal of 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria. In a single-sentence reference to that conflict, he said that as the “remnants” of the Islamic State are being destroyed, “it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.”

With most of his speech devoted to his domestic policies and the economy, Trump’s speech broke little new ground on his foreign-policy priorities.

[U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan tied to Afghan dialogue and a Taliban cease-fire]

He restated his announced intention to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, indirectly warning that the United States would build new nuclear systems to counter Russian gains.

“Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t — in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far,” Trump said.

Trump also announced a date and place for a second round of talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — Feb. 27-28, in Vietnam. “If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea, with potentially millions of people,” he claimed.

“Much remains to be done,” he said, “but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.” Regional experts have questioned whether significant progress has been made and whether North Korea is sincere in pledging denuclearization.

On other issues, Trump’s one-sentence condemnation of Nicolás Maduro’s government in Venezuela, and recognition of Juan Guaidó as interim president, was met with strong applause, as was his condemnation of Iran as “the world’s leading state sponsor of terror.”

He spoke of his decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but he did not mention the long-delayed Israel-Palestinian peace proposal he has said is being prepared under the direction of his son-in-law, senior White House aide Jared Kushner.

Recalling his campaign promise to end conflicts abroad, Trump said that “great nations do not fight endless wars.”

But his reluctance to put a date on promised troop withdrawals reflected the criticism and concern that met his mid-December orders to immediately start a complete exit from Syria and to begin planning to remove up to half of the force in Afghanistan.

In subsequent remarks on Syria, Trump said withdrawal would take place but would be slow and deliberate.

A large, bipartisan majority in the Senate voted Monday to oppose troop withdrawals from both countries. The nonbinding resolution, introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mc­Connell (R-Ky.), called on the White House to consult with Congress on developing long-term strategies in both nations, “including a thorough accounting of the risks of withdrawing too hastily.”

Trump referred to last week’s announcement that his special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, had drawn up a draft framework with Taliban representatives in which the militants agreed they would not allow al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups to operate on Afghan territory and the United States would agree to withdraw its forces.

Khalilzad said the draft was only a preliminary step in discussions that eventually would move to talks on a complete cease-fire and a political road map for the future agreed on between the Taliban and the Afghan government. President Ashraf Ghani has sharply objected to any talks that do not include the government, and his senior aides accused Khalilzad of “disrespect” and of trying to replace him with a more malleable successor.

In a brief mention, Trump said that he had “accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating,” he said. “As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troops’ presence and focus on counterterrorism.”

“We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.” The “other side,” he said, “would like to do the same thing. It’s time.”

Trump repeated familiar inaccuracies and exaggerations in congratulating himself on his policies in the Middle East. He has frequently described the situation in Iraq and Syria as “a mess” with the Islamic State ascendant. “When I took office,” he said, using an acronym for the militant group, “ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.”

The fight against the Islamic State was, however, well underway during the Obama administration. According to the Defense Department, the militants controlled at least 34,000 square miles of territory in both countries at its peak in late 2014. About half of that total had been liberated by the end of 2016, including all Iraqi cities except for western Mosul, and the northeastern section of Syria. The battle for Raqqa, the militants’ de facto capital in Syria, began in October 2016.

Trump also said in his address that the United States had spent “more than $7 trillion” on wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan. A figure that he has used in the past, it has been widely discounted as including projections of veterans’ care for the next 35 years.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-ties-troop-withdrawals-in-afghanistan-to-progress-in-peace-talks/2019/02/05/bc4ae35c-298b-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html,2019-02-05 00:00:00
washingtonpost,Two women accuse former Costa Rican president Óscar Arias Sánchez of sexual misconduct,"['Kevin Sieff', 'Latin America Correspondent', 'February At Pm']","Former Costa Rican president Óscar Arias Sánchez has been accused by a nuclear disarmament activist of sexual assault, a charge he denies. (Manu Fernandez/AP)

The former president of Costa Rica and Nobel laureate Óscar Arias Sánchez has been accused of sexual assault by a psychiatrist and antinuclear activist who says she met frequently with the former leader on disarmament issues.

The allegation was reported Tuesday by Semanario Universidad, a local newspaper, and the New York Times. In interviews with both publications, the accuser explained that, at one of her meetings with Arias, he approached her from behind, touched her breasts and penetrated her with his fingers. She filed a criminal complaint against Arias this week.

In a second allegation, Emma Daly, the head of communications at Human Rights Watch, told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday that Arias groped her in 1990, when she was a reporter covering Central America and while he was still president.

The accusations threaten to cast a dark cloud over the legacy of one of Costa Rica’s most celebrated leaders. Arias was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his work in ending Central America’s brutal civil wars. He was president of Costa Rica for two periods, from 1986 to 1990 and from 2006 to 2010.

“I had this fear that if I refused, he would not cooperate with us anymore,” the accuser told Semanario Universidad of the encounter, which she said occurred in 2014, referring to her hopes to engage Arias on disarmament issues.

“I did not know what to do. I felt trapped in that moment,” she said.

She could not be reached by The Post. An official at the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, where she once worked as a volunteer, said he believed she was not interested in speaking further about the incident. The Post generally does not name victims of sexual assault, alleged or proved, without their permission.

In a statement through his attorney Rodolfo Brenes, Arias denied the allegation to the Times.

“I deny categorically the accusations made against me,” he said. “I have never acted in a way that disrespected the will of any woman.”

Responding to Daly’s allegation late Tuesday, one of Arias’s attorneys, Gloriana Valladares, said in an email, “Since there is an ongoing investigation, our code forbids us to reveal information.”

Daly’s allegation has not previously been reported. In 1990, in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel in Managua, Nicaragua, she remembers calling out to Arias with a question for the then-president. They were both there for an event related to Nicaragua’s election.

Daly was then a reporter based in Costa Rica, working for the Tico Times and Reuters and frequently covering Arias. Instead of answering the question, Daly said, Arias ran his hand between her breasts and exclaimed, “You’re not wearing a bra.”

Daly recalled being shocked by the incident and so flustered that all she could think to say was “Yes, I am.” She said she didn’t think about making a formal complaint against Arias, in part because of how common behavior like that was in Central America at the time.

“We just kind of took it,” she said. “It seemed as if being treated like that came with the territory, and there wasn’t much I could do about it.”

Shortly after leaving the hotel, she said she told her then-boyfriend, Joe Gannon, what had happened. In a phone interview with The Post, he recalled how Daly described the incident.

“She was pissed,” he said, remembering that Daly called Arias by an expletive and exclaimed, “Can you believe this?”

She told her husband, Santiago Lyon, about the incident not long after they met in the mid-1990s, he said in an interview. It would come up periodically when Arias’s name was in the news.

“She was appalled obviously but not outwardly upset,” Lyon said, describing how Daly appeared while recounting the incident. “It was more a kind of astonishment at what had happened.”

The first allegation, from the psychiatrist, made waves across Costa Rica on Tuesday, with some calling it part of the country’s belated #MeToo moment. Among those who responded publicly was Arias’s successor, Laura Chinchilla Miranda, who addressed the allegations on Facebook.

“Experience confirms that for women victims of sexual harassment, it is extremely difficult to denounce the incidents because of the power relations that operate against them and intimidate them, and because of the stigmatization that they may be subjected to,” she wrote.

[In 2018, #MeToo — and its backlash— went global]

Semanario Universidad also published interviews and several text messages and email exchanges between the accuser and her friends and colleagues after the alleged incident. Those accounts appear to support her allegation.

In one text to a friend, she discussed receiving a call from Arias after the incident.

“I will ignore him forever,” she wrote in the message. “I hate him.”

In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint, known as a “denuncia,” prompts an official investigation.

But the system is often overwhelmed by the number of accusations it receives. In 2017, it received 211,000 complaints, including 9,400 which related to sexual abuse.

Costa Rica’s penal code says a jail sentence of up to 16 years can be imposed in sexual assault cases when the attacker “takes advantage of the vulnerability of the victim.”

washingtonpost,Venezuela military barricades bridge in attempt to block aid,"['Christine Armario', 'Scott Smith', 'February At Pm']","This image taken from video, shows a fuel tanker, cargo trailers and makeshift fencing, blocking the Tienditas International Bridge in an attempt to stop humanitarian aid entering from Colombia, as seen from the outskirts of Cucuta, on Colombia’s border with Venezuela, Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2019. Immigration authorities say the Venezuelan National Guard built the roadblock a day earlier. (Associated Press)

CUCUTA, Colombia — The Venezuelan military barricaded a bridge at a key border crossing with Colombia, issuing a challenge Wednesday to a U.S.-backed effort by the opposition to bring humanitarian aid into a nation plagued by shortages of food and medicine.

The Tienditas International Bridge was blocked the day before with a giant orange tanker, two large blue containers and makeshift fencing near the border town of Cucuta, Colombian officials said.

The bridge is at the same site where officials plan to store humanitarian aid that opposition leader Juan Guaido is vowing to deliver to Venezuela. The Trump administration has pledged $20 million in aid and Canada has promised another $53 million.

The aid squabble is the latest front in the battle between Guaido and President Nicolas Maduro, who is vowing not to let the supplies enter the country. Maduro argues Venezuela isn’t a nation of “beggars” and has long rejected receiving humanitarian assistance, equating it to a foreign intervention.

Venezuelan Jose Mendoza stood at the entrance to the Colombian side of the bridge holding a sign that said: “Humanitarian aid now.” Mendoza, 22, said he is tired of seeing Venezuelans suffer from food and medical shortages and that the military should stand on the side suffering Venezuelans.

“They have to be by the side of the people and support us,” Mendoza said. “They have family members who are dying of hunger. The call is for them too.”

Roughly 40 countries around the world have backed Guaido, who swore himself in as president in late January contending that as head of the opposition-led National Assembly he is Venezuela’s rightful leader because Maduro’s re-election last year was a sham.

Guaido says the emergency shipment is a “test” for Venezuela’s armed forces, which will have to choose if they allow the much needed aid to pass, or if they instead obey orders. No details have been released on exactly how the opposition plans to get the shipments into Venezuela.

Soaring hyperinflation has forced millions of Venezuelans to flee or go hungry as they struggle to find or afford basic goods and medicine.

Maduro appeared on state TV Wednesday evening wearing a white lab coat demonstrating what he considers Venezuela’s modern health care system in clinics countrywide — without mentioning attempts to block medical supplies at the border.

“The revolution is more alive than ever,” Maduro said. “We’re advancing in the development of health care for the good of the people.”

An emphatic U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Venezuelans desperately need the emergency supplies that the U.S. and other countries are preparing to provide.

“Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid,” Pompeo tweeted. “The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE.”

Guaido on Wednesday accused Maduro’s government of rejecting the assistance because officials often handed out imported food and medicine in exchange for bribes.

Speaking to farmers, Guaido said the transitional government he’s mounting to replace Maduro is taking steps to make Venezuela self-reliant.

“We don’t want to depend more on a food subsidies than is necessary today,” he said, calling the blockade an “absurd reaction from a government that doesn’t have the interest and well-being of Venezuelans” in mind.

Maduro has clung to power with the support of Venezuela’s highest-ranking military officers. He dismisses Guaido as a puppet of the United States, which he says is seeking to colonize Venezuela and exploit its vast oil resources.

In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Donald Trump vowed to ratchet up pressure on Maduro, saying that the U.S. stands with the people of Venezuela.

“We condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair,” Trump said.

In a trip to Washington on Wednesday, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said that any attempt to block aid from entering Venezuela is tantamount to “a crime.”

“Committing such a crime would give even more reason for the unified countries to ask the International Criminal Court to investigate Maduro,” Trujillo told reporters after a meeting with the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro.

Colombia shares a 1,370-mile (2,200-kilometer) border with Venezuela and is backing Guaido. The neighboring Andean nation has received over one million Venezuelan migrants in the last three years.

Looking up at the giant containers blocking the bridge Wednesday, aid worker Alba Pereira shook her head and dismissed the barricade as another government ploy. She said that humanitarian volunteers would find a way to get the aid into the country regardless.

“It’s a means of intimidation,” said Pereira, director of the nonprofit Entre Dos Tierras, which aids Venezuelans migrants. “But I don’t think it will accomplish anything.”

Guatemala’s attorney general’s office asked on Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2019, that the immunity of Torrez, who is now an official presidential candidate and is therefore immune from prosecution, be lifted as she now stands accused of several electoral crimes during her 2015 presidential run. (Oliver de Ros, File/Associated Press)

GUATEMALA CITY — Prosecutors in Guatemala sought Wednesday to have presidential candidate Sandra Torres Casanova’s immunity from prosecution withdrawn over a case of millions in alleged illicit campaign financing four years ago.

Juan Francisco Sandoval, head of the anti-impunity prosecutors’ office, or FECI, said Torres’ National Unity of Hope party is suspected of receiving about $2.5 million for the 2015 presidential election from businesses, contributions that were not reported to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.

“The crimes which would be charged are illicit association, perjury, illicit and unreported electoral financing and tax fraud,” Sandoval said.

At a news conference, Torres laid blame on former chief prosecutor Thelma Aldana, who is planning her own presidential bid, and accused Sandoval of persecuting her at Aldana’s bidding.

“We see dark political intentions behind all this. Behind all this there is a person (Aldana), a criminal structure embedded in the FECI. It wants to harm me,” Torres said, adding that she would not allow the election to be “stolen.”

Torres ran in the 2015 race, which was won by current President Jimmy Morales. She was accredited Tuesday as a candidate for the election this June, a status that confers legal immunity from prosecution.

Sandoval also said four people were arrested, prosecutors were seeking to lift the immunity of four lawmakers from the same party and the party’s headquarters were being searched for documents related to the case.

Under Guatemalan law the request to withdraw Torres’ immunity will go to the Supreme Court for consideration.

Wednesday’s announcement by prosecutors arose from an investigation in partnership with a U.N.-sponsored anti-corruption commission that Morales has moved to sideline after it pressed investigations of him, some relatives and some associates. The president denies wrongdoing.

As chief prosecutor Aldana worked closely with the commission, known as CICIG, bringing graft cases that swept up dozens of public officials and businesspeople including then-President Otto Perez Molina. That record brought her acclaim at home and abroad and put her in position to launch a presidential bid this year.

National Unity of Hope is the party of former President Alvaro Colom, who was elected in 2008 and is currently free on bail while under investigation for purported embezzlement. He, too, denies wrongdoing.

CUCUTA, Colombia — The Venezuelan military barricaded a bridge at a key border crossing with Colombia, issuing a challenge Wednesday to a U.S.-backed effort by the opposition to bring humanitarian aid into a nation plagued by shortages of food and medicine.

The Tienditas International Bridge was blocked the day before with a giant orange tanker, two large blue containers and makeshift fencing near the border town of Cucuta, Colombian officials said.

The bridge is at the same site where officials plan to store humanitarian aid that opposition leader Juan Guaido is vowing to deliver to Venezuela. The Trump administration has pledged $20 million in aid and Canada has promised another $53 million.

The aid squabble is the latest front in the battle between Guaido and President Nicolas Maduro, who is vowing not to let the supplies enter the country. Maduro argues Venezuela isn’t a nation of “beggars” and has long rejected receiving humanitarian assistance, equating it to a foreign intervention.

Venezuelan Jose Mendoza stood at the entrance to the Colombian side of the bridge holding a sign that said: “Humanitarian aid now.” Mendoza, 22, said he is tired of seeing Venezuelans suffer from food and medical shortages and that the military should stand on the side suffering Venezuelans.

“They have to be by the side of the people and support us,” Mendoza said. “They have family members who are dying of hunger. The call is for them too.”

Roughly 40 countries around the world have backed Guaido, who swore himself in as president in late January contending that as head of the opposition-led National Assembly he is Venezuela’s rightful leader because Maduro’s re-election last year was a sham.

Guaido says the emergency shipment is a “test” for Venezuela’s armed forces, which will have to choose if they allow the much needed aid to pass, or if they instead obey orders. No details have been released on exactly how the opposition plans to get the shipments into Venezuela.

Soaring hyperinflation has forced millions of Venezuelans to flee or go hungry as they struggle to find or afford basic goods.

An emphatic U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Venezuelans desperately need the emergency supplies that the U.S. and other countries are preparing to provide.

“Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid,” Pompeo tweeted. “The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE.”

Guaido on Wednesday accused Maduro’s government of rejecting the assistance because officials often handed out imported food and medicine in exchange for bribes.

Speaking to farmers, Guaido said the transitional government he’s mounting to replace Maduro is taking steps to make Venezuela self-reliant.

“We don’t want to depend more on a food subsidies than is necessary today,” he said, calling the blockade an “absurd reaction from a government that doesn’t have the interest and well-being of Venezuelans” in mind.

Maduro has clung to power with the support of Venezuela’s highest-ranking military officers. He dismisses Guaido as a puppet of the United States, which he says is seeking to colonize Venezuela and exploit its vast oil resources.

In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Donald Trump vowed to ratchet up pressure on Maduro, saying that the U.S. stands with the people of Venezuela.

JOHANNESBURG — The United States said Wednesday it is cutting some military aid to Cameroon over human rights concerns after growing allegations of abuses by security forces, a significant step against a solid ally in central Africa that is gripped by fighting between the government and Anglophone separatists.

The U.S. decision comes after videos circulated online last year showing Cameroonian security forces shooting and killing civilians, including women with small children strapped to their backs. The videos were documented by Amnesty International and global media outlets.

The top U.S. diplomat for Africa, Tibor Nagy, said in December that he feared the separatist crisis could get “much, much” worse and warned against a “brutal response” to extremism, saying it could lead to radicalization. Cameroon also faces a deadly threat from fighters with the Boko Haram extremist group based in neighboring Nigeria.

The United Nations has said some 430,000 people in Cameroon’s Southwest and Northwest regions have fled the fighting between security forces and English-speaking separatists who seek independence from the largely French-speaking country.

There was no immediate comment from Cameroon’s government on the U.S. action.

The Pentagon and State Department said the reduced U.S. support involves armored vehicles, boats, aircraft upkeep and parts, helicopter training and an invitation to a partnership program.

“We do not take these measures lightly, but we will not shirk from reducing assistance further if evolving conditions require it,” the State Department said. It added: “We emphasize that it is in Cameroon’s interest to show greater transparency in investigating credible allegations of gross violations of human rights security forces, particularly in the Northwest, Southwest, and Far North Regions.”

A Pentagon spokeswoman, Navy Cmdr. Candice Tresch, gave no dollar amount for the value of assistance being cut.

In a statement, Amnesty International’s deputy director for advocacy and government programs, Adotei Akwei, urged the U.S. to suspend all security assistance “until the Cameroonian government can show it has not been utilized to commit serious violations of international law and persons responsible have been held accountable.”

Akwei also called on the Trump administration to press other donors to review their assistance to Cameroon and insist on reforms.

In August, Amnesty International said a “horrifying” video circulating on social media showed Cameroon’s security forces firing automatic weapons on at least a dozen unarmed civilians cowering against a wall during a counterterror operation in the Far North region. The rights group said its analysis found the video was apparently made by soldiers and recorded before May 2016.

“Speaking in French, the soldiers describe themselves as carrying out a ‘kamikaze’ operation,” the rights group said.

That followed another video in July that Amnesty International said showed Cameroonian forces shooting two women with small children strapped to their backs as suspected Boko Haram extremists. Cameroon sought to dismiss that video, with its ambassador to Canada telling reporters in Washington: “You know what Photoshop can do.”

The growing concerns have posed a challenge for 85-year-old President Paul Biya, who is one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders. He became president in 1982 and won another term in October’s election, after which the military launched fresh offensives against the separatists.

Biya has ordered investigations into the shootings shown in the videos and some people have been arrested, government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary has said.

In the past, Cameroon’s government has denied such killings by security forces as they combat Boko Haram, whose fighters have spilled over the border into the Far North region and carried out bombings and other attacks.

SAO PAULO — Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was convicted Wednesday for a second time on charges of corruption and money laundering and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Judge Gabriela Hardt said she agreed with prosecutors that a country house was renovated for da Silva by construction companies involved in the mammoth corruption scandal centered on Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras.

Last April, da Silva began serving a sentence of 12 years and 11 months after being convicted on the same charges involving renovations at a beach-front apartment also allegedly paid for by construction companies.

Prosecutors argued that both cases involved the companies giving benefits to da Silva in return for political favors.

Da Silva has denied guilt in both cases and is expected to appeal the latest sentence, as he did the first.

(Associated Press)

TURIN, Italy — Egyptologists and other experts gathered in Italy this week to celebrate a successful campaign to save ancient Egyptian temples from being submerged by a dam project 50 years ago and heard of cultural sites facing similar threats now.

The international campaign that saved the temples of Abu Simbel during construction of Aswan High Dam was remembered in Turin as an unprecedented engineering achievement and a turning point that made the preservation of cultural treasures a responsibility that cut across borders.

But experts at the Monday event said that with major dam projects underway in Sudan and Ethiopia, the job of protecting Nubian culture is not finished.

The director of Turin’s Egyptian Museum, Christian Greco, noted that the focus in a modernizing Egypt half a century ago was on saving major monuments, largely due to time pressure.

Recording and salvaging settlements and domestic artifacts received less emphasis, and many were lost underwater when the dam across the Nile River and its lake reservoir went in, she said.

“Unfortunately, we know that the traces, above all of pre-history before mummies, were lost under the waters of Nasser Lake,” Greco said. “It also needs to be a lesson for the future because there are still great challenges.”

In 1960, the United Nations’ cultural agency, UNESCO, issued an international appeal to save the temples of Amu Simbel, an ancient gateway to pharaonic Egypt, dedicated to Ramses II and his wife Nefertiti.

More than 113 countries responded with funds or expertise. Marble cutters from Carrara in central Italy, engaged by an Italian construction company that now goes by the name Salini Impregilo, led the job of breaking down the imposing sandstone temples into 1,070 blocks.

Expert marble cutters from Carrara engaged by the Italian construction firm Impregilo, today Salini Impregilo, led cutting of the imposing sandstone temples into 1,070 blocks. The blocks were subsequently moved to higher ground, and the temples reconstructed and positioned as ancient architects intended: allowing the sun to shine on the end wall two days each year.

Ana Luiza Thompson-Flores, director of UNESCO’s office in Venice, said it was debated at the time whether the $36 million earmarked for the temples’ preservation would have been better spent on initiatives such as ending poverty.

But Thompson-Flores said the global response ultimately “was the birth of the recognition that there were aspects of this world, whether monuments or landscapes, that actually have a recognized outstanding universal value for humanity.”

washingtonpost,Danish Jehovah’s Witness sentenced to six years in prison in Russia,"['Anton Troianovski', 'Moscow Bureau Chief Covering Russia', 'February At Am']","A Russian court sentenced a Danish Jehovah’s Witness to six years in prison for extremism Wednesday, one of the harshest verdicts in years against a Western citizen here and the latest incident in Russia’s crackdown on personal freedoms.

The Jehovah’s Witness, Dennis Christensen, was detained in May 2017 after a police raid on his congregation in the city of Orel, south of Moscow, and has been in jail ever since. On Wednesday, the district court ruled he was guilty of “organizing the activity of an extremist organization,” according to the Russian branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

The Russian Supreme Court ruled Jehovah’s Witnesses to be an extremist organization in 2017, ordered its activities banned, and said its property could be seized. Christensen is the first member of the religious group to be sentenced for extremism, said Tanya Lokshina, the Moscow-based associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division.

The ruling comes amid an ongoing crackdown on personal and civil liberties in Russia and sends the message that people’s prominence or foreign citizenship won’t protect them from prosecution.

“Six years in jail for peacefully practicing your own religion is something that comes right out of the history book on Soviet dissent,” Lokshina said. “It sends a very strong signal to all those who are ready to stand up that there will be no mercy.”

Christensen will appeal the decision, the Russian branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses said.

Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said his country would continue to assist Christensen and called on Russia “to respect freedom of religion.” Yaroslav Sivulsky, a representative of the European Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses, said Christensen was punished for “reading the Bible, preaching, and living a moral way of life.”

Russian authorities have described Jehovah’s Witnesses — the group says it has about 170,000 believers in Russia — as a threat to public order. At the Russian Supreme Court, the government brought in former followers to testify that top church officials took “total control” of their “intimate life, education and work.” The Jehovah’s Witnesses’ lawyers have denied those allegations.

Founded in the United States in the 19th century, Jehovah’s Witnesses reject subservience to the state and believe God to be the only true ruler. They do not serve in the military or vote.

Scores of other Jehovah’s Witnesses are in detention around the country, watchdog groups say.

In a meeting with human rights activists in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin described extremism charges against Jehovah’s Witnesses as “nonsense,” leading to speculation that legal pressure on the religion’s believers would soon stop. Wednesday’s ruling, however, shows this is not the case.

[Russia just effectively banned Jehovah’s Witnesses from the country]

Russia’s current crackdown extends beyond religion. It comes as the Kremlin faces growing signs of public discontent amid persistent reports of official corruption and a deeply unpopular government plan to raise the retirement age. Putin’s approval ratings have fallen to their lowest level since before his annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014, which was widely lauded at home. They are still at 64 percent, according to the independent Levada-Center, but well down from earlier levels in the 80s.

Oyub Titiev, head of the human rights organization Memorial’s Chechnya office, has spent more than a year behind bars on drug charges that his lawyers insist are fabricated. In December, Russia detained an American, Paul Whelan, on spy accusations — though officials haven’t said what he was spying on or on whose behalf.

In January, authorities in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don charged activist Anastasia Shevchenko for “repeated participation in the activities of an undesirable organization” — the first time ever that such criminal charges have been filed in Russia, according to Amnesty International. The “undesirable organization” in question is Open Russia, a human rights group founded by exiled former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

The state may now be laying the groundwork for an even more far-reaching crackdown on dissent. A draft law pending in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, would create the groundwork for the Russian Internet to be isolated from the rest of the world.

“We’ve seen very dire developments where freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association are concerned,” Human Rights Watch’s Lokshina said.

washingtonpost,"U.S. cuts some military assistance to Cameroon, citing allegations of human rights violations","[""Siobhán O'Grady"", 'Worldviews Reporter', 'February At Pm']","The United States is scaling back its security assistance to Cameroon following credible allegations that the Cameroonian military carried out human rights violations in the Central African country, the State Department said Wednesday.

Cameroon is a key U.S. security partner, and about 300 U.S. troops are based there to train and assist the Cameroonian military, including in its fight against extremism in its far northern region. Human rights groups have reported that Cameroonian security forces have targeted civilians, in the far north and in the country’s unstable southwest and northwest regions, where the military is battling English-speaking separatists fighting to create a breakaway nation called Ambazonia.

“We emphasize that it is in Cameroon’s interest to show greater transparency in investigating credible allegations of gross violations of human rights security forces, particularly in the Northwest, Southwest, and Far North Regions,” the State Department said through a spokesman via email Wednesday.

Security cuts will include the “provision of four defender boats and nine armored vehicles, and the upgrade of a Cessna aircraft belonging to the Rapid Intervention Battalion,” or BIR, the department said.

Members of the BIR, an elite force that has received assistance from the United States, have been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses. The Washington Post reported this week that English speakers from Cameroon’s two Anglophone regions said members of the BIR burned down civilians’ homes and executed a pregnant woman. The Cameroonian military denied targeting civilians.

The U.S. aid cuts also include the withdrawal of a U.S. offer for Cameroon’s candidacy in the State Partnership Program, which pairs American states’ National Guards with another country’s armed forces, delivery of certain equipment and helicopter training.

Washington “will not shirk from reducing assistance further if evolving conditions require it,” the State Department said.

In more than a dozen interviews with displaced English speakers in Cameroon, witnesses described to The Post how the Cameroonian military fired indiscriminately at civilians, in some cases driving moderate Cameroonians to begin supporting the separatists. Col. Didier Badjeck, a spokesman for Cameroon’s Defense Ministry, said the allegations of human rights abuses amounted to “propaganda.”

Last summer, Amnesty International released an analysis of two videos that appeared to show Cameroonian security forces executing unarmed people, including children, in the country’s far northern region.

In August, the Cameroonian government claimed it had arrested soldiers in connection with one video and launched an investigation of the other.

On Wednesday, Adotei Akwei, Amnesty’s deputy director for advocacy and government, urged the United States to suspend “all security assistance until the Cameroonian government can show it has not been utilized to commit serious violations of international law and persons responsible have been held accountable.”

washingtonpost,Pompeo slams Venezuelan president over blocking of humanitarian aid,"['Mariana Zuñiga', 'February At Pm']","Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted Nicolás Maduro Wednesday, accusing the Venezuelan president of blocking the path of humanitarian aid into the impoverished country.

The United States, which has called for Maduro’s ouster and recognized National Assembly head Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has been coordinating with other countries in the region to deliver food and other provisions to Venezuela for the benefit of the people. But on Wednesday, ahead of anticipated aid shipments, a bridge that would have been an entry point into Venezuela from Colombia was blocked by a tanker truck and two shipping containers placed horizontally across its lanes.

“The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid,” Pompeo tweeted. “The U.S. & other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE.”

National security adviser John Bolton also tweeted about Venezuela on Wednesday, saying senior officers with the Venezuelan military — an institution that has been vital to Maduro’s grip on power — could be shielded from financial penalties if they abandon Maduro and recognize “the constitutional government of President Juan Guaidó. If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely.”

The United States and dozens of other countries have refused to recognize Maduro’s presidency because of what was roundly criticized as a fraudulent election last year. Instead, they have backed Guaidó, a relative novice of a politician who has nonetheless rallied tens of thousands of Venezuelans in street protests against Maduro. The Trump administration has also dealt serious financial blows to the government by freezing overseas bank accounts and imposing sanctions on the state-owned oil company, cutting off the most significant revenue flow for that country. Russia, Cuba and China have continued to stand with Maduro.

Stuck in the middle of the geopolitical drama are the people of Venezuela — and the humanitarian aid.

While eager to see Venezuelans receive much-needed help, relief agencies and nongovernmental organizations worry that aid is being politicized and could become a pawn in this and future political brawls.

“Humanitarian action has to be independent of politics, military and other objectives,” Stéphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman, told journalists in New York.

Mario Villarroel, president of the Red Cross in Venezuela, insisted that his organization would not take sides. “When this material is given to us, we go under the criteria of neutrality, impartiality, independence,” he said, referring to humanitarian supplies.

The latest friction appears to have started over the weekend, when Venezuelan military personnel were seen roaming cities along the Colombia-Venezuela border, according to opposition lawmaker Franklyn Duarte. On Tuesday, he said, Venezuelan troops began blocking the Tienditas international bridge, which connects Venezuela and Colombia.

He said it was ironic that rank-and-file members of military — many of whom suffer from the food shortages and hyperinflation ravaging the oil-rich nation — were being called on to block the path of aid into the country.

“We reiterate the call to the national armed forces because we know that those soldiers are in need of food and medicine, too,” he said. “There are many in the military that don’t agree anymore with attacking the people.”

washingtonpost,The glaring hole in Trump’s State of the Union address: Climate change,"['Ishaan Tharoor', 'Reporter Covering Foreign Affairs', 'Geopolitics', 'February At Am']","Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

President Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday night zigzagged between paeans to unity and sops to his hardcore base. He eulogized World War II soldiers and then wheeled on immigrants and leftist rivals at home. But absent amid the nativist demagoguery and partisan jockeying was any reference to the threat looming above all others: climate change.

That’s no surprise. Trump is an avowed climate skeptic who casts environmentalist efforts as challenges to American sovereignty, not ways to stave off a planet-wide disaster. As much of the United States endured a deep freeze last month, Trump took to Twitter to plead for more “global warming.”

In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2019

Experts quickly noted that the president was confusing weather with climate — and that the warming of the Arctic could lead to sharper, snowier cold spells in the North American winter.

“Only with an ill-informed citizenry could you plausibly dismiss the consensus of the world’s scientists based upon a single cold spell,” wrote climate scientist Michael E. Mann. “Trump and, more to the point, the fossil fuel interests whose bidding he is doing have weaponized the public’s poor understanding of science.”

Trump is certainly at odds with the global scientific community — including leading scientists in the United States and even in his own government. In November, the Trump administration tried to bury the terrifying findings of its own National Climate Assessment by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving. In that report, researchers affiliated with a number of federal agencies offered alarming conclusions about the increased risk of natural catastrophes because of the changing climate.

The U.S. assessment landed just a few weeks after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its own stark warning. The global scientific body wrote that humanity has barely more than a decade to slash carbon emissions on an unprecedented scale to avoid calamity. “Absent aggressive action, many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040,” the New York Times wrote in October.

Now, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, Trump’s climate denial is being thrown in his face. Democrats will hold the first House hearing on climate change in six years on Wednesday. And at the State of the Union itself, they brought in a host of academics and activists focused on the climate as their guests.

“The climate-themed invitees run the gamut, from longtime climate activist Bill McKibben, who was invited by Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), to relative newcomers such as Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, who got a seat from Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.),” noted Dino Grandoni of The Washington Post’s Energy 202 newsletter.

“Instead of tackling the problem head-on, President Trump is burying his head in the sand and handing out favors to his friends in the coal industry,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who invited University of Washington climate scientist Lisa Graumlich as her guest, said in a statement.

For some, there’s no time left to debate with climate change deniers. While the United States shivered, Australia experienced its hottest January on record, a volatile period that saw vast wildfires in Tasmania, epic floods in the country’s northeast that brought crocodiles into town streets and searing heat and drought that led to the mass deaths of fish in parched rivers.

Experts in Australia warned that whole swaths of the country’s coastline could become uninsurable. For right-wing Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who came to office thanks in part to a party revolt against his predecessor’s climate activism, it presents an intensifying political headache.

“It’s extremely inconvenient for any government that does not have a cogent answer for what they’ll do about climate change, to see the effects of climate change putting more and more people and homes at risk,” said Greg Mullins, a decorated former Australian fire chief, to the Sydney Morning Herald. He added that fire seasons “are longer, more severe” and that blazes are “much harder to put out.” This seems also true in California, beset by increasingly devastating wildfires each year.

The extreme weather being experienced in Australia right now is a worrying glimpse of what #climatechange means. Hottest January on record; worst monsoon flooding in a century. These impacts slam people, the environment, and the economy. #climate pic.twitter.com/W4Ysnv1pm1 — Peter Gleick (@PeterGleick) February 4, 2019

On top of the extreme weather, two staggering new studies added to the sense of impending doom. Researchers discovered an “enormous void” under a major Antarctic glacier, a hole amounting to some 14 billion tons of ice that have disappeared within the past three years.

Experts now fear that the melting of Antarctic ice is occurring at a scale and pace previously not imagined. If this particular glacier collapses — something that could happen anywhere between 50 and 100 years from now — sea levels would rise by about two feet across the globe. That’s enough to radically affect life in myriad coastal towns and cities.

A separate study involving more than 350 scientists and policymakers from 22 countries estimated that at least a third of the huge ice fields in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush mountain ranges will be gone by the end of this century — and that’s even if the most ambitious emissions targets are met by countries around the world. The Asian mountain ranges’ vast glaciers have been known as the “Third Pole” and are the major source of drinking water for close to 2 billion people.

“This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” Philippus Wester, a water and climate scientist at the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, said in a statement. “Global warming is on track to transform the frigid, glacier-covered mountain peaks … to bare rocks in a little less than a century.”

For Trump, that may be a timeline of no consequence to his political career. But his inaction and indifference is already part of a broader political legacy likely to be remembered in decades to come.

washingtonpost,Pope Francis confirms Catholic clergy members abused nuns,"['Max J. Rosenthal', 'Assignment Editor For The Worldviews Blog', 'Michelle Boorstein', 'Religion Reporter', 'February At Am']","Pope Francis has acknowledged that members of the Catholic clergy abused nuns, adding to a string of recent allegations about widespread sexual abuse by priests and coverups by the church hierarchy.

“It’s not that everyone does this, but there have been priests and bishops who have,” Francis told reporters aboard the papal plane on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. The wire service and other outlets had reported on allegations of nun abuse over the past year, but the pontiff had not confirmed that such abuse took place.

Francis is due to host a gathering of bishops and cardinals in two weeks to address the broader global issue of clergy sexual abuse — including, largely for the first time, adult victims and accountability for those at the top of the church who mismanage and cover it up.

The Washington Post’s Stefano Pitrelli and Chico Harlan wrote in September, when the meeting was announced, that the gathering “is believed to be unprecedented, indicating that the church recognizes that clergy sex abuse is a global problem — even in countries where the church maintains strong social power and cases have not come to light in great numbers.”

“The Church’s credibility has been seriously undercut and diminished by these sins and crimes, but even more by the efforts made to deny or conceal them,” Francis wrote in a letter to U.S. bishops last month. “This has led to a growing sense of uncertainty, distrust and vulnerability among the faithful.”

Asked Tuesday whether he would take a similarly broad approach to tackling the abuse of nuns, Francis signaled that he would. “Should we do something more? Yes. Is there the will? Yes. But it’s a path that we have already begun,” he said, the AP reported.

Speaking about the progress the church has made on the issue, Francis referred to the offshoot French religious congregation that had been dissolved by Pope Benedict XVI after a founding priest had violated chastity vows with women in the order. On the plane, Francis said that some women had been pushed by the priest into “sexual slavery.” But the Vatican on Wednesday clarified that remark, saying that Francis was referring instead to manipulation and the abuse of power.

Francis has been criticized in the past for his handling of the topic. In January 2018, he dismissed accusations that Chilean bishop Juan Barros had covered up sexual abuse committed by a priest named Fernando Karadima. “There is not one shred of proof against him. It’s all calumny. Is that clear?” the pope said at the time. He later apologized and dispatched investigators to Chile but did not condemn Barros.

Some have also criticized what they consider a slow Vatican response to major sexual abuse scandals that broke in other countries, including Australia and the United States.

“The church remains quiet about its investigations and disciplinary procedures,” Harlan reported last year. “It does not release any data on the inquiries it has carried out. A proposed tribunal for judging bishops accused of negligence or coverup was quashed by the Vatican department that was supposed to help implement it. And, rather than being fired and publicly admonished, offending church leaders are typically allowed to resign without explanation.”

A few high-profile allegations against top Catholic clerics by nuns have gained attention in the past year, with some Catholics calling it a #MeToo moment for religious sisters.

Last fall, Indian nuns in the state of Kerala made news by marching with placards, demanding action against a bishop they say raped a nun between 2014 and 2016. After reportedly getting no response from the church to her complaint, she went to police in June — a radical move in the state.

“There are many nuns within the church who are suffering. They are afraid to come out. The church mechanism is a very large and powerful one,” Indulekha Joseph, a lawyer who was helping the women, told The Post last year. “The other problem is once a nun speaks, she is thrown out of the convent and may find herself on the street, because often her family is not willing to accommodate her. A campaign of character assassination starts. The nun will be portrayed as a prostitute.”

Last month, a Vatican official who handles sexual abuse cases for the church quit after being accused of sexual abuse by a former nun. The woman, Doris Wagner, last year accused an unnamed priest of making sexual advances on her while in a confessional. She later identified the priest as Hermann Geissler, who was chief of staff of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a body that handles discipline in sexual abuse cases within the Catholic Church.

Geissler has maintained his innocence but said he was resigning to protect the church.",http://washingtonpost.com/world/2019/02/05/pope-francis-confirms-catholic-clergy-members-abused-nuns/?tid=pm_world_pop,2019-02-05 00:00:00

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.

Online Tracking & Advertising

How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How To Disable These Technologies

We and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality or measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.

Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service

Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.

Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.

Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising

As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.

In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .

Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Please visit our Ad Choices page for additional information and privacy choices.

She Was Previously A Reporter At The Dallas Morning News.']","1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Great Barrier Reef has lost half its coral View Photos A new study shows that the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, spurred by factors such as hurricanes, coral-eating starfish and coral bleaching.

Soon, beachgoers won’t be able to buy certain top-selling sunscreens along parts of the Florida Keys.

The Key West City Commission voted Tuesday night to ban sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate, two chemicals that have been shown to be damaging to coral reefs. Beginning in January 2021, Key West will ban such sunscreens from sale within city limits — taking a cue from Hawaii, which became the first state to pass a similar ban.

“To me, this is a pretty black-and-white issue,” Key West Mayor Teri Johnston said ahead of the vote.

“There are thousands of sunscreens out there, and we have one reef,” she added. “And we have an opportunity to do one small thing to protect that. I believe it’s our obligation.”

[The biggest coral reef in the continental U.S. is dissolving into the ocean]

Though sunscreen brands such as Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sell some products without oxybenzone and octinoxate, there are still many containing those chemicals on drugstore shelves.

For years, oxybenzone and octinoxate have been used to protect people’s skin from UV radiation, but some research has shown that skin care products containing these chemicals can wash away from the skin while swimming or bathing and seep into the water, causing damage to coral reefs.

Johnston, the mayor, said that the Great Florida Reef, which is the largest reef in the continental U.S., is vital to the tourist town both environmentally and economically and that banning the sunscreens containing those toxins was simply “the right thing to do.” She said that leading up to the vote, documentation was presented on both sides of the debate, but it seemed to her that there were adequate nontoxic sunscreens that would both protect people’s skin, as well as marine life.

In a 6-to-1 vote Tuesday night, the city commission banned the sale of sunscreens containing the chemicals.

The mayor said she hopes the ban will also bring awareness, explaining that though city cannot keep visitors from bringing banned sunscreens to its beaches, it can discourage them.

“I hope it will make consumers more aware and responsible for their actions,” Johnston said in a phone interview Wednesday with The Washington Post. The goal, she said, is for people to “flip over their sunscreens and look at the ingredients and make wise choices for themselves and their families.”

Last summer, Hawaii passed legislation banning skin-care companies from selling and distributing sunscreens on the islands that contain oxybenzone and octinoxate. The bill was opposed by various companies and business associations and even some dermatologists, who worried it might discourage people from wearing sunscreen. Still, Gov. David Ige (D) signed the bill, making Hawaii the first state to enact legislation designed to protect marine ecosystems by banning such sunscreens.

The U.S. Geological Survey has called America’s coral reefs “imperiled national treasures,” stating that the limestone structures under the sea are “dying at alarming rates.”

That’s a problem for both marine animals and humans because, in addition to protecting sea creatures, coral reefs provide food, medication and tourism jobs for people, which has been valued at $30 billion to $172 billion per year, according to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.

“Unfortunately, people also pose the greatest threat to coral reefs,” according to the Smithsonian. “Overfishing and destructive fishing, pollution, warming, changing ocean chemistry, and invasive species are all taking a huge toll. In some places, reefs have been entirely destroyed, and in many places reefs today are a pale shadow of what they once were.”

The National Park Service has urged people to take a “reef friendly” approach to sunscreen shopping, instead buying skin-care products that contain titanium oxide or zinc oxide, which are considered natural alternatives to the two chemicals that will soon be banned from sale in Key West.

The National Park Service states:

Sunscreens are among the products we are encouraged to use liberally to protect ourselves from the sun’s harmful rays. However, researchers are finding that while protecting humans, some compounds in many sunscreens can harm the coral on our reefs. Researchers testing the effects of sunscreen on corals explain that chemicals in sunscreen can awaken coral viruses. The coral then becomes sick and expel their life-giving algae. Without these algae, the coral “bleaches” (turns white), and often dies. We may not realize that the products covering our skin wash off when we enter the water, and it adds up! Research tells us that 4,000 to 6,000 TONS of sunscreen enters reef areas annually. This does not spread out rapidly or evenly over the entire ocean, but concentrates on popular tourist sites. It is estimated that 90% of snorkeling/diving tourists are concentrated on 10% of the world’s reefs. This means that our most popular reefs, such as those in our national parks, are exposed to the majority of sunscreens.

washingtonpost,Her texts urged a boyfriend to kill himself. A judge just upheld her conviction.,"['Kayla Epstein', 'Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk', 'Lindsey Bever', 'General Assignment Reporter Covering National', 'Breaking News', 'Kristine Phillips', 'Reporter Covering National', 'February At Pm']","In 2017, Michelle Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for persuading her boyfriend via text messages to die by suicide. She appealed the decision, but her conviction was upheld Wednesday by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

In a ruling written by Justice Scott L. Kafker, the court stated that “the evidence was sufficient to support the judge’s finding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed involuntary manslaughter as a youthful offender.""

“By her wanton or reckless conduct, she caused the victim’s death by suicide,” the ruling concluded. “Her conviction of involuntary manslaughter as a youthful offender is not legally or constitutionally infirm.”

Carter’s lawyer, Daniel N. Marx, said in a statement to The Washington Post that they were considering further legal options, including a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“We are disappointed in the Court’s decision, which adopts a narrative that we do not believe the evidence supports. We continue to believe that Michelle Carter did not cause Conrad Roy’s tragic death, and she should not be held criminally responsible for his choice to end his own life,” Marx said.

Carter, now 22, and the victim, Conrad Roy III, met in 2012, according to court documents. They maintained their relationship via text messages and frequently discussed mental health issues. Roy had previously attempted suicide, and Carter had planned to seek treatment for an eating disorder.

Initially, Carter urged Roy to seek help, but “as the victim continued researching suicide methods and sharing his findings with the defendant, the defendant helped plan how, where and when he would do so, and downplayed his fears about how his suicide would affect his family,” the court wrote, citing several text exchanges.

[‘I heard him die’: The text messages at the heart of Michelle Carter’s homicide trial]

“I thought you wanted to do this. The time is right and you’re ready, you just need to do it!” Carter texted Roy in July 2014 as he was having doubts about going through with suicide. They discussed methods, including carbon monoxide poisoning.

On July 13, 2014, Roy’s body was found in a vehicle in a Massachusetts parking lot. He died of carbon monoxide inhalation that was produced “by a gasoline-powered water pump located in the truck,” the ruling said.

In September 2014, Carter texted a friend, writing, “His death is my fault like honestly I could have stopped him I was on the phone with him and he got out of the car because it was working and he got scared and I [expletive] told him to get back in.”

He was 18 when he died. Carter was 17 at the time.

[‘It’s now or never’: Texts reveal teen’s efforts to pressure boyfriend into suicide]

Three years later, Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Roy’s death, and her case hinged on the text messages she sent him as he contemplated suicide, and the fact that she did not try to prevent him from carrying out the suicide. She was sentenced by Bristol County Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz to 2½ years in prison but would be eligible for probation after 15 months and was allowed to remain free as she appealed the decision, CBS News reported.

It was a closely watched case not just for its startling details, but also for the legal implications of Carter’s conviction.

After the conviction, Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told The Post that the case sends a strong message that “there are new means of committing old crimes,” and prosecutors will be more likely to look at those cases. She argued that the case did not set legal precedent but raised the question, “When does bullying cross over into committing a homicide?”

The Massachusetts branch of the American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about the greater implications of the ruling Wednesday.

“Conrad Roy’s suicide is indisputably tragic. But, by upholding Michelle Carter’s conviction, the Supreme Judicial Court has handed prosecutors broad, undefined powers that diminish the speech rights of everyone in Massachusetts,” legal director Matt Segal said in a statement.

“The Court’s decision tells prosecutors that they can bring charges against individuals based on arbitrary and subjective determinations of what speech is noble and what speech is criminal,” Segal continued. “This prosecutorial power will chill important and loving end-of-life discussions between family members, and could lead to erroneous convictions of children who engage in reckless, juvenile conversations with friends. The Court’s assurance that its opinion will not broadly criminalize other speech does little to change this inevitable outcome.”

Marx issued similar sentiments Wednesday, telling The Post that the decision “stretches the law” and has “troubling implications, for free speech, due process, and the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”

In upholding the conviction Wednesday, the court decided that Carter’s claim that her conduct was protected by the First Amendment, among other defenses, “lack[ed] merit.”

washingtonpost,BAFTA drops Bryan Singer from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ nomination over sexual misconduct allegations,"['Sonia Rao', 'Pop Culture Reporter', 'February At Pm', 'Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter. She Attended Boston University', 'Wrote For The Boston Globe Before Coming To The Post As A Style Intern In She Officially Joined The Features Department In']","

The British Academy of Film and Television Arts has removed Bryan Singer’s name from the “Bohemian Rhapsody” nomination for outstanding British film because of “recent very serious allegations” of sexual misconduct against the director. The film itself will retain the nomination, as well as six others in craft and acting categories.

“BAFTA considers the alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with its values,” the academy wrote in a statement Wednesday, days before its award ceremony. “This has led to Mr Singer’s suspended nomination. BAFTA notes Mr Singer’s denial of the allegations. The suspension of his nomination will therefore remain in place until the outcome of the allegations has been resolved.”

BAFTA’s decision comes almost two weeks after GLAAD deemed the Queen biopic ineligible for its outstanding film category in response to the allegations against Singer that were published last month by the Atlantic. The roughly 9,000-word article detailed graphic accounts of four people who said Singer sexually assaulted them when they were underage. Singer denied the allegations and responded at the time with a statement that called the article a “homophobic smear piece,” an assertion GLAAD called out in announcing the film’s ineligibility.

“Bohemian Rhapsody” earned five Oscar nominations last month, including best picture. Unlike BAFTA, however, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awards best picture only to the film’s producers — in this case, Graham King. Both King and screenwriter Anthony McCarten’s names remain on the BAFTA nomination. Neither one, nor Singer, has responded to The Washington Post’s request for comment on the director’s suspension.

The film’s rocky awards season follows a chaotic production process that began in 2010. Queen guitarist Brian May announced the movie that year, when the plan was for shooting to kick off in 2012 with comedian Sacha Baron Cohen as frontman Freddie Mercury. Cohen left the project in 2013 over creative differences, and British actor Ben Whishaw stepped in to replace him. That deal also fell apart. In 2016, Rami Malek was confirmed for the lead role, with Singer attached to direct.

Twentieth Century Fox wound up firing Singer a few weeks before the end of “Bohemian Rhapsody’s” production because of his unreliable behavior. The Hollywood Reporter pointed to his prolonged absences from set and tension with Malek as the reason, though Singer denied the latter and said he was caring for an ill family member. While Singer retained the credit, Dexter Fletcher, whose name had been attached to the project back when Whishaw’s was, took over the remaining directing duties.

Malek has picked up quite a few trophies for his performance in the film, including a Golden Globe. But he has also been criticized for staying relatively quiet about the allegations against Singer. After receiving a best-actor Oscar nomination, he told the Los Angeles Times that he “was not aware of” Singer’s history of sexual misconduct allegations before signing on to the project. As pressure to comment on the allegations grew, Malek spoke more candidly last week during a panel at the Santa Barbara Film Festival.

""My heart goes out to anyone who has to live through anything like what I’ve heard and what is out there,” Malek said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “It’s awful. It’s remarkable that this happens. I can appreciate so much what they’ve been through and how difficult this must be for them. In the light of the #MeToo era that this somehow seems to exist after that. It’s a horrible thing.”

He continued: “In my situation with Bryan, it was not pleasant, not at all. And that’s about what I can say about it at this point. For anyone who is seeking any solace in all of this, Bryan Singer was fired. Bryan Singer was fired. I don’t think that was something anyone saw coming, but I think that had to happen, and it did.""

Malek received a BAFTA nomination for his performance in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which was also honored in the makeup and hair, cinematography, editing, sound and costume design categories.

theguardian,Cavity two-thirds the size of Manhattan discovered under Antarctic glacier,['Lisa Cox'],"Scientists have discovered a giant cavity at the bottom of a disintegrating glacier in Antarctica, sparking concerns that the ice sheet is melting more rapidly than expected.

Researchers working as part of a Nasa-led study found the cavern, which they said was 300 metres tall and two-thirds the size of Manhattan, at the bottom of the massive Thwaites glacier.

Build walls on seafloor to stop glaciers melting, scientists say Read more

The space is big enough to have contained 14bn tonnes of ice and most of that ice has melted during the past three years.

In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists said the rapid change in the ice was “unexpected” at some points on the glacier.

The researchers found the cavity using Italian and German satellites and ice-penetrating radar from Nasa’s Operation IceBridge, which uses research aircraft to monitor changes in polar ice.

“[The size of] a cavity under a glacier plays an important role in melting,” said the study’s lead author, Pietro Milillo, who is scientist at the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “As more heat and water get under the glacier, it melts faster.”

But Milillo told the Guardian the size of the underwater cavity was not the main concern because the 14bn tonnes it released were already underwater and so would not contribute to sea level rise. The important aspect of the paper, he said, was what it revealed about the interaction between sea and ice.

Jeremie Mouginot, a co-author of the paper and a research scientist at the Université Grenoble Alpes, said ocean water was filling a widening gap between the floating ice shelf and the bedrock.

Thwaites, he said, was a 120km-wide “monster glacier” that is continuing its retreat with huge future implications, because it could potentially add 0.6 metres to rising seas.

Thwaites also supports neighbouring glaciers that, if they melted, would increase sea levels by an additional 2.44 metres, threatening coastal communities worldwide.

Portrait of a planet on the verge of climate catastrophe Read more

Mouginot said further studies would be needed on where and how Thwaites will decline. “The current question is not if the glaciers will retreat but at which pace.”

There are already new investigations of Thwaites under way, including one by a UK team, as well as studies of other Antarctic regions.

The hole is on the glacier’s western side and has been melting at a rate of about 0.6 to 0.8km a year since 1992, a rate that while stable was “extremely high”, Nasa said.

Eric Rignot, a co-author of the study, said understanding how warming oceans were melting the glacier away was “essential to project its impact on sea level rise in the coming decades”.

“We have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/07/cavity-two-thirds-the-size-of-manhattan-discovered-under-antarctic-glacier,2019-02-07 00:00:00
theguardian,Met Office: global warming could exceed 1.5C within five years,['Jonathan Watts'],"Lowest Paris agreement target may temporarily be surpassed for first time between now and 2023

Global warming could temporarily hit 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for the first time between now and 2023, according to a long-term forecast by the Met Office.

Meteorologists said there was a 10% chance of a year in which the average temperature rise exceeds 1.5C, which is the lowest of the two Paris agreement targets set for the end of the century.

Climate change set to disrupt Australia's summer sports calendar Read more

Until now, the hottest year on record was 2016, when the planet warmed 1.11C above pre-industrial levels, but the long-term trend is upward.

Man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are adding 0.2C of warming each decade but the incline of temperature charts is jagged due to natural variation: hotter El Niño years zig above the average, while cooler La Ninã years zag below.

In the five-year forecast released on Wednesday, the Met Office highlights the first possibility of a natural El Niño combining with global warming to exceed the 1.5C mark.

Dr Doug Smith, Met Office research fellow, said: “A run of temperatures of 1C or above would increase the risk of a temporary excursion above the threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Predictions now suggest around a 10% chance of at least one year between 2019 and 2023 temporarily exceeding 1.5C.”

Climatologists stressed this did not mean the world had broken the Paris agreement 80 years ahead of schedule because international temperature targets are based on 30-year averages.

“Exceeding 1.5C in one given year does not mean that the 1.5C goal has been breached and can be redirected towards the bin,” said Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer at the Grantham Institute. “The noise in the annual temperatures should not distract from the long-term trend.”

Although it would be an outlier, scientists said the first appearance in their long-term forecasts of such a “temporary excursion” was worrying, particularly for regions that are usually hard hit by extreme weather related to El Niño. This includes western Australia, South America, south and west Africa, and the Indian monsoon belt.

They also noted that the probability of 1.5C years would steadily increase unless emissions were rapidly scaled back.

“It’s a warning that we’re getting close to that level,” Prof Adam Scaife, the head of long-range prediction at the Met Office, told the Guardian. “We’re not saying there is a current risk of breaching the Paris agreement. What we are saying is that for the first time, we are seeing a chance of a temporary rise of 1.5C due to a combination of global warming and natural climate variation.”

The Met Office said previous results had demonstrated the accuracy of such “decadal reports”, which cover the ground between short-term weather forecasts and long-range climate models.

Since 2014, the world has experienced the four hottest years since records began in 1850, but these highs are likely to be exceeded soon. From now until 2023, the Met has 90% confidence that mean annual temperatures will range between 1.03C and 1.57C above pre-industrial levels.

The recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on warming of 1.5C, highlighted the calamitous difference even a fraction of a degree above could make to coral reefs, Arctic ecosystems and hundreds of millions of lives. Starting now, the report said emissions would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 to have any chance of holding to that level.

“Breaching 1.5C of global warming does indeed mean that we failed to limit warming to that ‘safe’ level, but not that our understanding of a safe level of climate change has suddenly changed and climate change should go unchecked,” said Rogelj, who was was a coordinating lead author on the UN report. “Every tenth of a degree matters. So if 1.5C of global warming would be exceeded for whatever reason, this would be a call for steeper emissions reductions.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,"2018 was world's fourth hottest year on record, scientists confirm",['Oliver Milman'],"Global temperatures in 2018 were the fourth warmest on record, US government scientists have confirmed, adding to a stretch of five years that are now collectively the hottest period since modern measurements began.

The world in 2018 was 1.5F (0.83C) warmer than the average set between 1951 and 1980, said Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). This means 2018’s average global temperatures were the fourth warmest since 1880, placing it behind 2016, 2017 and 2015.

Is climate change way worse than we realise? Read more

This follows a broader pattern of human-induced climate change, which is boosting increasingly punishing heatwaves, sea level rises and extreme weather. Last year saw a pair of devastating hurricanes hit the eastern US, while record wildfires ravaged California.

There was disastrous flooding in India, a huge typhoon in the Philippines and deadly wildfires in Greece and Sweden. The Arctic, which had its second warmest year on record, experienced temperature highs that astonished scientists.

“2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

“The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt – in coastal flooding, heatwaves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change.”

Schmidt said that 2018 was “quite clearly the fourth warmest year on record and it was probably warmer than many hundreds of years before that”.

He added he was “very concerned with what is going on in the Arctic”, which is heating up at around double the rate of the global average. Average extent of sea ice in the Arctic was the second smallest on record in 2018.

Nasa and Noaa’s annual climate reports, which were delayed because of the federal government shutdown, echo findings by Berkley Earth and Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which both recently stated 2018 was the fourth warmest on record.

Each new year may not set a temperature record but the long-term warming “resembles riding up an escalator over time and jumping up and down while on that escalator”, said Deke Arndt, chief of Noaa’s climate monitoring division, referring to variables such as the El Niño pattern. “The jumping up and down can be driven by internal processes.”

On Wednesday, the World Meteorological Organization announced it, too, measured 2018 as the fourth warmest on record. It said 2016 remains the warmest on record due to a particularly strong El Niño, which is a periodic event that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean and influences weather patterns around the world.

“The long-term temperature trend is far more important than the ranking of individual years, and that trend is an upward one,“ said Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the WMO. “The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. The degree of warming during the past four years has been exceptional, both on land and in the ocean.”

Taalas said the extreme weather events of the past year have had “devastating repercussions” for people, economies and ecosystems.

“Many of the extreme weather events are consistent with what we expect from a changing climate,” he said. “This is a reality we need to face up to. Greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate adaptation measures should be a top global priority.”

Schmidt said that without an El Niño, 2017 would be the warmest year on record, with 2018 the third warmest. This year has started with mild El Nino conditions, “which suggests 2019 will be warmer than 2018 but that’s more a rule of thumb than a firm prediction”, Schmidt said.

The relentless warming has highlighted the steep challenges faced by governments if they want to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The world needs to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by the 2030s to avoid breaching limits set out in the Paris climate agreement, the UN warned last year, at a time when global emissions show no sign of decline.

Britain’s Met Office on Wednesday warned the 1.5C temperature increase limit agreed in Paris, compared with a pre-industrial baseline, could start to be exceeded far sooner than many predicted. The Met Office said there is a 10% chance of at least one year between 2019 and 2023 temporarily exceeding 1.5C.

In January, the same organization warned that levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide will rise by a near-record amount in 2019. Levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere have not been as prevalent on Earth for at least 3 million years – a period when the seas were 10-20 meters higher.

“The Earth has taken a walloping since 2014,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Eighteen of the 19 warmest years since record keeping began have occurred since 2001. That means kids graduating from high school have only known a world of record-breaking temperatures.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/global-temperatures-2018-record-climate-change-global-warming,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,"The killing of large species is pushing them towards extinction, study finds",['Oliver Milman'],"The vast majority of the world’s largest species are being pushed towards extinction, with the killing of the heftiest animals for meat and body parts the leading cause of decline, according to a new study.

While habitat loss, pollution and other threats pose a significant menace to large species, also known as megafauna, intentional and unintentional trapping, poaching and slaughter is the single biggest factor in their decline, researchers found.

An analysis of 362 megafauna species found that 70% of them are in decline, with 59% classed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Direct killing by humans is the leading cause across all classes of animals, the study states. A range of maladies including intensive agriculture, toxins and invasive competitors are also helping to trigger these declines.

This situation adds to the “mounting evidence that humans are poised to cause a sixth mass extinction event”, according to the research, published in Conservation Letters. It adds that “minimizing the direct killing of the world’s largest vertebrates is a priority conservation strategy that might save many of these iconic species and the functions and services they provide.”

Humans cause the deaths of large creatures in a variety of ways, from snares that entangle mountain gorillas and the poaching of elephants for ivory to the killing of the Chinese giant salamander, which can grow up to 6ft long and is considered a delicacy in Asia.

“Sometimes the killing is legal, sometimes illegal and sometimes unintentional, such as by catch during fishing,” said William Ripple, lead author and a professor of ecology in the Oregon State University. “If this trend continues we will lose many of its megafauna species and the world will become an impoverished place. We are heading towards them dwindling away.”

Humans have hunted the largest animals for thousands of years but technology has allowed them to be targeted far more efficiently, the study notes, with nine megafauna species becoming extinct in the past 250 years, including two types of giant tortoise and two varieties of deer.

Besides the intrinsic value of imposing creatures such as rhinos, sharks and tigers, many of them perform an important ecological role as predators at the top of the food web or by spreading seeds throughout habitat.

The industrialized slaughter of livestock for food, along with well-regulated hunting, isn’t to blame for the loss of species, the research found, although other studies have illustrated the sweeping environmental harm caused by mass agriculture.

“It’s a complex issue. Sometimes large animals are killed for trophies, sometimes it’s subsistence hunting and fishing, sometimes its illegal poaching – it runs the gamut,” Ripple said. “Humans have become super predators who don’t even have to come into contact with the things we are killing. Many of these large animals have low reproduction rates so once you add in that pressure they become vulnerable.”

The crisis in the natural world has been laid bare by recent research, which illustrated that only 4% of the world’s mammals, by weight, are wild, with the other 96% made up of humans and livestock. Since 1970, populations of wild mammals, birds fish and amphibians have, on average, slumped by 60%.

Conservationists have called for a radical overhaul that would require an end to mass deforestation and the setting aside of a third, or maybe even half, of the world to nature. Looming challenges posed by climate change and a rapidly increasing human population will also have to be met if the losses are to be stemmed.

“We need international treaties that work, we need to take action together to save these species,” Ripple said. “We’ve made progress with some species, such as whales through the International Whaling Commission. We need governments to work together for other megafauna.”

The research is “another log on the fire and follows a known, disturbing narrative that we are killing species to extinction,” said Erle Ellis, an ecologist at the University of Maryland, who was not involved in the study.

“I’d be suspicious of just saying ‘stop eating them’ because while unregulated hunting is definitely a bad thing, there are species hunted like white-tailed deer that are doing just fine. Megafauna are the rock stars of the biodiversity world, so they get the money and fame. There are lots of other species that do a lot of important things that deserve some of that attention, too.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/the-killing-of-large-species-is-pushing-them-towards-extinction-study-finds,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,Body recovered from wreckage of Emiliano Sala's plane,['Mattha Busby'],"Authorities yet to confirm if remains are those of missing footballer or pilot David Ibbotson

A body has been recovered from the wreckage of the plane that crashed in the Channel with footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson on board, three days after the aircraft was found.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has not said whether the body is that of the Argentinian striker or that of the pilot, following their disappearance on 21 January.

Using remotely operated vehicles in “challenging conditions” in poor weather, the AAIB and its specialist contractors successfully recovered the body previously seen amid the wreckage following extensive visual examinations of the accident site.

“The operation was carried out in as dignified a way as possible and the families were kept informed of progress,” the AAIB said in a statement. “Unfortunately, attempts to recover the aircraft wreckage were unsuccessful before poor weather conditions forced us to return the ROV to the ship.

“The weather forecast is poor for the foreseeable future and so the difficult decision was taken to bring the overall operation to a close. The body is currently being taken to Portland to be passed into the care of the Dorset coroner.”

Emiliano Sala: missing Premier League footballer’s plane found Read more

The Piper Malibu plane taking Sala to Cardiff from Nantes in France disappeared shortly after the 28-year-old signed for the Premier League club Cardiff City, with scrutiny focusing on the pilot for using a loophole enabling him to fly on his US licence.

Ibbotson, 59, had requested to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control during the flight from France to Wales. The aircraft wreckage remains where it was found, more than 60 metres underwater, 21 miles north of the Channel island of Guernsey. The footballer’s family are desperate for the plane to be recovered from the seabed.

However, the AAIB said it had not been possible to recover the aircraft. “The extensive video record captured by the ROV is expected to provide valuable evidence for our safety investigation,” the AAIB statement said. “We expect our next update to be an interim report, which we intend to publish within one month of the accident occurring.”

The AAIB said previously that the work of the ROVs was hampered by the difficult tidal conditions around the Channel Islands. Despite this, the aircraft’s remains were tracked down within two hours of the search commencing by a team coordinated by ocean scientist David Mearns, who has located some of the most elusive wrecks in the world.

He told the Press Association that the discovery had been so quick because his team had been looking for a static object, as opposed to survivors in a dynamic environment. “No one should walk away with the impression that the Coastguard and also the Channel Islands air search did anything other than a professional job,” he added.

An official search operation was called off on 24 January after Guernsey’s harbour master, David Barker, said the chances of survival following such a long period were “extremely remote”, but the search resumed after an online appeal raised almost £350,000.

On Wednesday, it emerged that Cardiff received a letter from Nantes, Sala’s previous club, threatening to launch legal proceedings if the first scheduled transfer fee payment is not received within the next 10 days.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/body-recovered-from-wreckage-of-emiliano-salas-plane,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,Nantes demand first slice of £15m Emiliano Sala fee from Cardiff,['Stuart James'],"Cardiff City have been left shocked and dismayed after Nantes demanded the first instalment of the transfer fee for Emiliano Sala, who was on board a plane that went missing a little over a fortnight ago.

It is understood that Cardiff received a letter from Nantes on Tuesday, in which the French club threatened to take legal action if the first scheduled payment is not received within the next 10 days.

Although Nantes were entitled to the first slice of Sala’s reported £15m fee by now, there is a sense of disbelief at Cardiff given the circumstances and the timing. The plane that Sala was travelling on was only discovered on Sunday and the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) has not said whether the body spotted in the wreckage, which was found on the seabed, is that of the Argentinian striker or David Ibbotson, the pilot.

Nantes emailed Cardiff last Thursday in relation to the payment terms and the Welsh club’s failure to transfer the first of three instalments. They then followed up that message five days later with a more direct demand that referenced possible legal action.

From Cardiff’s point of view, the priority is to establish all the facts around the tragedy. There is no suggestion that the Welsh club will not meet their contractual obligations, but at the moment there is a desire and determination to gather all the relevant information first – and that could mean waiting until an official investigation is completed.

Sala was insured by Cardiff after signing for the club on 19 January, two days before his ill-fated flight back from Nantes, where he had returned to say goodbye to his former teammates. It is believed that Cardiff have a player insurance policy of £16m per individual and that Sala was registered under those terms on the morning of 21 January.

Yet many grey areas remain and unless Cardiff change their stance, which seems unlikely, there is the potential for the two clubs to become embroiled in a long-running dispute. To complicate matters further, Bordeaux, the French club Sala switched from to join Nantes, are also entitled to a significant percentage of the transfer fee – possibly as much as 50% – after inserting a sell-on clause back in 2015.

All the while, the AAIB is continuing with their operation, after the plane was found 67m underwater, 21 miles off the coast of Guernsey in the English Channel. An official search for the Piper Malibu was called off on 24 January, when Guernsey’s harbour master, David Barker, said the chances of survival after such a long time were extremely remote.

A privately funded search for the plane, backed by Sala’s family and thousands of people who donated money as part of a crowdfunding exercise, got underway on Sunday, and the plane was found within two hours.

Conditions, however, are far from ideal. An AAIB spokesman said: “We are attempting to recovery the body. If we are successful, we will consider the feasibility of recovering the aircraft wreckage.Strong tidal conditions mean we can only use the remotely operated vehicle for limited periods each day and this will mean that progress is slow. Regardless of the results, we will not be making a further statement until the families have been informed.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/nantes-demand-transfer-fee-from-cardiff-city-for-emiliano-sala,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,Venezuelan troops blockade bridge to stop aid from Colombia,"['Tom Phillips', 'Joe Parkin Daniels']","Venezuelan troops have barricaded a bridge on the country’s western border with Colombia in an apparent attempt to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid sent by opposition leaders trying to force Nicolás Maduro from power.

On Wednesday at lunchtime, a fuel tanker and two shipping containers blocked the Tienditas international bridge, which connects the two countries and has become a staging ground for the planned relief effort. Members of Venezuela’s Bolivarian national guard could also be seen at the bridge.

A convoy carrying the aid, which was donated by the US, left Bogotá at 11am on Wednesday and was making its way along winding mountain rounds to Cúcuta, a Colombian government official said. The earliest it will reach the border is Thursday morning.



‘They are murderers’: special forces unit strikes fear in Venezuelans Read more

Maduro has repeatedly denied his economically devastated country is facing a humanitarian crisis, apparently fearing such an acceptance could be used to justify foreign military intervention. “We are not beggars,” he said in a speech to troops this week.

Play Video 2:46 Why is Venezuela in crisis? – video explainer

The attempt by his political rival, Juan Guaidó, to push aid in through Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil represents the latest attempt to weaken Maduro’s embattled regime by forcing members of the military to disobey his orders and allow the aid to pass.

“The main goal now is to look to break the military – and the humanitarian aid is basically the Trojan horse to try to do that,” said Maryhen Jiménez Morales, an Oxford University specialist in Venezuelan politics.

Guaidó urged Venezuela’s border troops not to stand in the way of humanitarian aid that was intended to help “your family, your sister, your mum, your wife – who surely need these supplies”.

Juan Andrés Mejía, a lawmaker from Guaidó’s party, Voluntad Popular (People’s Will), told the Guardian that trying to deliver aid across Venezuela’s borders was a double challenge to Maduro’s regime – as well as an effort to alleviate a humanitarian crisis that has seen millions of Venezuelans flee abroad.

“The government has a dilemma … Either they let it in [and look weak] or they refuse it, which I don’t think they will because they are not so stupid, and they will also lose. So it is a win-win situation for us – and for the people.”

Mejía denied that the opposition hoped to provoke a military incident which some fear could be used to justify international intervention to unseat Maduro. “That’s not our goal. That is not what we are looking for. Basically, the strategy … is to show people that humanitarian aid is real, [that] it is not only a discourse … and it is close and it can be here soon.”

Mejía added: “We are a non-violent movement. We do not have weapons and we do not want to have them. We are absolutely certain that violence benefits the government and we cannot win a violent struggle against the government.”

The United Nations warned against using aid as a political tool. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives,” said a spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric. “When we see the present standoff it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary to find a solution leading to lasting peace for the people of Venezuela.”

A congressman from Cúcuta, Juan Capacho, told the Guardian the blockade was a “tyrannical irresponsibility that we will get over”, and that the aid would “help give Venezuela liberty”.

Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, tweeted: “The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The U.S. & other countries are trying to help, but # Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE.”

However, Maduro and members of his inner circle have remained publicly adamant that the aid will not be allowed in.

“With this show of humanitarian aid they are trying to send a message: ‘Venezuela has to go begging to the world!’ And Venezuela will not beg for anything from anyone in this world,” Maduro said on Monday.

On Tuesday, Diosdado Cabello, another top Chavista, depicted the aid effort as part of a hostile foreign military intervention that would be rebuffed.

“Our territory must be respected. As our brother President Nicolás Maduro has said: any military unit that tries to penetrate our territory will be repelled and our Bolivarian national armed forces will defend our territory. There should be no doubt about it.”

“We love you,” reads a note beside a black and white photograph of the recently killed teen.

It was 10pm on the night of 22 January when friends arrived outside with the news that Pisani was dead; gunned down as he demonstrated against Nicolás Maduro’s teetering regime in Catia, a traditionally working-class area of western Caracas.

“He was still just a boy,” said the woman who raised him, his aunt, Nivea Pisani.

“They are murderers … demons,” she said of her nephew’s killers. “He just went out to protest because we are going hungry. How many more will die if we carry on like this?”

Pisani, an unemployed 45-year-old, is still waiting for an official explanation about who shot her nephew and why. His death certificate states he died from a firearm injury but offers no hint of the weapon used – or the motive.

But she believes his killers were from Faes, a shadowy and fearsome special forces unit activists suspect Maduro has tasked with pacifying the city’s impoverished redbrick barrios in a bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of Chavismo.

“The poor areas are where most people live – and since we don’t support them any more I guess they want to kill us all,” said Pisani, who says witnesses told her Faes agents arrived at the protest shortly before her nephew was shot in the arm and chest.

Hugo Chávez first took office in January 1999 – just a few months before Alixon Pisani was born – vowing to blaze a Boilvarian trail for Venezuela’s long-forgotten poor.

In his first post-election speech, the comandante promised he would not rest while there were still children in the streets and families going hungry. “Today a new battle starts for the salvation of Venezuela,” Chávez said.

In the early years of Chavismo, its leader won global accolades and a cult following for his crusade to help Venezuela’s poor. Social projects known as misiones brought healthcare and education to millions of disenfranchised citizens.

“[Chávez] showed us there is a different and a better way of doing things: it’s called socialism, it’s called social justice,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in 2013.

But two decades after Chávez’s rise to power, Venezuela is on its knees, and many who were once loyalists have lost faith in his successor. And, increasingly, they are taking to the streets to demand change.

“We’ve never had protests here in Catia – this is new,” said Pisani, attributing the shift to the country’s economic and social collapse under Chávez’s heir.

“Before, I’d open my fridge and see ham, cheese, eggs, meat, chicken. These days there’s nothing but water – and sometimes we don’t even have that. It’s insanity – we never thought we’d be living like this,” she said.

The day he died, Alixon Pisani – who worked in a local bakery – had gone out to protest the “beggary” into which their oil-rich nation has been plunged. “It’s as if there is no government in this country,” Pisani complained. “How can you not go out to protest?”

Across town, in a sprawling eastern neighbourhood called José Félix Ribas, Venezuela’s special forces have also made their deadly presence felt in an apparent bid to crush dissent.

“It’s the first time they’ve attacked with so much force,” said one local woman, too scared to be named, as she and other residents described a series of war-like operations in the days after opposition leader Juan Guaidó sparked the current political crisis by declaring himself Venezuela’s rightful president on 23 January.

A second woman recalled balaclava-wearing, rifle-toting troops swarming into the labyrinthine community like an army of “little black ants”, kicking down doors and shooting.

“We heard the bangs: tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka. It was horrible,” said the woman, whose home was stormed.

“They want to silence the barrios because we are the most affected [by the crisis],” she added. “They want to silence the barrios – but it’s impossible because people have had enough.”

“Even the Chavistas around here don’t agree with Nicolás Maduro,” said her 18-year-old son, who described narrowly escaping death during one operation, sprinting over rooftops and down alleys as the agents opened fire.

The teenager, who now sleeps in another part of Caracas for fear of being killed, agreed the repression was designed to dissuade the urban poor from leaving their hilltop homes to join the revolt. “If the barrio goes down it will be like a nuclear bomb.”

Things were not always thus, a group of locals explained as they sat around a wooden table in a kitchen equipped with nothing but a broken stove and an almost bare pantry.

“Chávez would go into the barrios, into any house, and whichever house Chávez went into they’d say: ‘Have a little cup of coffee, my presidente,’” said the 18-year-old. “They adored him. They loved him.”

And what if Maduro came calling today?

“I’d hit him with a chair,” he replied.

“We’d keep him here for a week eating what we have to eat – lentils and beans – to see if he liked it,” his mother chuckled sarcastically.

“Without any salt,” chipped in a third woman.

Faes – the special action force – has earned notoriety since the uprising against Maduro began last month. Graffiti artists have daubed Caracas’ walls with messages denouncing its operatives as “murderers of the people”.

But little is known about the elite group’s inner workings or even who exactly commands it. In a recent report, the Venezuelan human rights group Provea said Faes was created by Maduro in 2017 to fight “organized crime and terrorism” and was part of Venezuela’s national police force, although some stories in state-run media outlets describe it as being under the command of the Venezuelan military. By last year it boasted almost 1,300 agents.

In a recent post on its Instagram account the group said its role was to “guarantee security, tranquility and peace” for all Venezuelans.

But activists say it has taken on an explicitly political role since the most severe challenge to Maduro’s rule erupted last month.

In one Instagram video, a Faes commander urges troops to show “absolute loyalty to Maduro” given the “extremely difficult moments” his administration was facing. “As soldiers who are faithful to the revolution, let’s go for it, let’s really go for it – without hesitation,” he says.

Provea’s coordinator, Rafael Uzcátegui, said: “What the government is trying to do is contain the discontent, to contain the anger – not by addressing the citizens’ concerns but by instilling terror and fear.”

What next for Venezuela? The four most likely outcomes Read more

Uzcátegui said his group had counted 43 killings linked to the protests. It had not been possible to identify the perpetrators of each death but he believed Faes was the number one culprit, followed by the pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos. Faes’ role appeared to be “neutralizing the greatest possible number of people”, not bringing criminals to justice.

Asked about alleged Faes killings on Venezuelan television last week, the attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said the criminal responsibility for such acts was “individual. Those who commit violations ... will be prosecuted, whichever part of the police they are from.”

On Monday, as she prepared for the last of nine evenings of mourning, Pisani said she felt uneasy about the prospect of foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro, but was adamant he had to step down.

“I want him to go. He must realize this country is a disaster,” she said.

Most of all, though, she wanted answers about the masked gunmen who had condemned her nephew to an unmarked concrete grave.

theguardian,Mayor's joke about building wall around Apple HQ city angers neighbors,['Vivian Ho'],"Communities around tech-rich Cupertino – teased they would pay for a wall – say city’s lack of affordable housing means they already subsidize it

A Donald Trump joke usually lands well in the heart of Silicon Valley. But when the mayor of Cupertino wisecracked in his state of the city address that he wanted to build a wall around the city where Apple is headquartered – and make the surrounding communities pay for it – he ignited a fury among local housing advocates, for whom the farce veered too close to reality.

Mayor Steven Scharf made his speech on 30 January, but it drew little attention until it was tweeted by venture capitalist and housing advocate Kim-Mai Cutler. Leading up to remarks on traffic, Scharf pulled up a PowerPoint slide titled, “Securing Our Borders With The Cupertino Wall” that showed a map of the city with the border marked in black.

“You have heard about the wall along our southern border,” Scharf said, alluding to Trump’s fight for a border wall with Mexico. “This is the wall around Cupertino. We have a big problem with all these Teslas coming through our city from Saratoga and other people from other cities, so we came up with this proposal.

“San Jose will be mainly paying for it, so it’s not coming out of our own taxes. Saratoga will give a little bit too, since they are a big contributor to our traffic issue,” he joked.

Under the map, the slide stated, “Santa Clara, Saratoga, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, and San Jose Will Pay For It” – a reference to the five communities that surround the city.

They pointed out that because of its lack of affordable housing, in a way, Cupertino – like the rest of Silicon Valley and the Bay Area – has already made surrounding communities “pay” for the wealth that has flooded the region from the tech industry.

“Cupertino is a city that, for the longest time, has fought new housing construction,” said Matt Regan, senior vice-president of housing policy for the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “They haven’t permitted a single permit for affordable housing in over three years. The city’s median home value right now is over $2.2m. Median rent value right now is $3,200 a month. They essentially already have built a wall around their city by making it so unaffordable to live in and refusing to build more housing.”

Because of the lack of affordable housing in the area, more than 200,000 people a day commute into job centers like Cupertino, Regan explained.

He continued: “If you’re fortunate enough to own a home in Cupertino, lucky you. But if you have to teach the children of Cupertino or work in the restaurants in Cupertino or clean the streets of Cupertino, you’re likely not owning a home in Cupertino.”

“Cupertino needs to carry its share of the load,” Regan said. “Next to the Apple campus, Cupertino is refusing to build housing. This is the crux of the housing and jobs imbalance right here. It’s just one example of many, but it is probably the most egregious in our region.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/cupertino-wall-mayor-apple-joke,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,Corbyn lays out Labour’s terms for backing May on Brexit,"['Heather Stewart', 'Jessica Elgot']","Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister, offering to throw Labour’s support behind her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments – including joining a customs union.

The Labour leader held private talks with Theresa May last week for the first time since her deal was rejected by a historic margin of 230 votes in January.

In a follow-up letter sent on Wednesday, he laid out in the clearest terms yet what commitments he is seeking in exchange for offering Labour support.

His intervention will dismay backbench Labour MPs and grassroots activists still hoping he will switch the party’s policy towards demanding a second Brexit referendum – which is not mentioned in the letter.

And it comes as No 10 prepares to publish legislation underpinning workers’ rights, perhaps as early as next week, in an attempt to win support from Labour backbenchers.

In his letter, Corbyn calls for the government to rework the political declaration setting the framework for Britain’s future relationship with the EU – and then enshrine these new negotiating objectives in UK law, so that a future Tory leader could not sweep them away after Brexit.

He says the changes to the political declaration must include:

A “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union”, including a say in future trade deals.

Close alignment with the single market, underpinned by “shared institutions”.

“Dynamic alignment on rights and protections”, so that UK standards do not fall behind those of the EU.

Clear commitments on future UK participation in EU agencies and funding programmes.

Unambiguous agreements on future security arrangements, such as use of the European arrest warrant.

There is no mention of the second of the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer’s six tests, which said that Labour would not support any deal that failed to deliver the “exact same benefits” as single market and customs union membership.

Labour’s approach, which Corbyn called “constructive”, appears to be focused firmly on the forward-looking political declaration, rather than the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which contains the Irish backstop and the divorce bill.

“We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the withdrawal agreement, as we discussed when we met,” Corbyn writes.

“However, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs,” he says.

He does not explicitly say that article 50 should be extended – a move that the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, described as “sensible” on Wednesday.

But he said that because of the government’s negotiating failures “time has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised”. He added: “Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of no deal, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome.”

He concluded: “My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.”

May has so far vehemently resisted the prospect of reopening the political declaration, focusing instead on securing changes to the Irish backstop, which has been the flashpoint for Brexiter Conservative MPs.

But at the same time, her government has been trying to win over Labour backbenchers with new legally binding promises on workers’ rights.

She could propose a new draft bill as early as next week guaranteeing that UK workers’ rights will keep pace with Europe.

Backbench Labour sources said the new bill was in the late stages of drafting and would include a “regression lock” that the UK parliament would ensure workers’ rights would never slip below European standards. That approach appears likely to come close to meeting one of Corbyn’s five tests.

Multiple Labour MPs who have met May over the past few months have made it clear to her that they needed the guarantees to be made in primary legislation – because they do not trust that May will remain in No 10 for much longer.

Those who are in negotiations with the government have insisted that the bill must be tabled and have had at least one day of second reading within the next few months.

The Labour MP John Mann, one of the key figures behind the push for legislation, said: “There needs to be a bill produced soon. We aren’t basing anything on a promise, with all due respect to the prime minister. We are doing it based on statute.”

The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who has also intimated she could back May’s deal, said the right offer from No 10 could win over up to 60 Labour MPs.

“If she were able to come back, and stop this eternal circular conversation within the Tory Party, and start reaching out to the rest of parliament and the rest of the country and give us those assurances, I think you’d get somewhere between 40 and 60 Labour [MPs] who would be prepared to step forward and say: we’ve got to come together around this, otherwise we leave with no deal,” Nandy told BBC Radio 5 Live.

But Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield and a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer … In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party – a people’s vote.”

Trade unions are understood to have been pushing for the legislation to include an easing of restrictions on union activity. Union leaders had been seeking more concrete proposals for regulation of the labour market after Brexit and the enforcement of existing law.

“Their desire to bring in seasonal agricultural workers from around the globe, as well as barista visas, really does ring alarm bells,” one union source said. “Our fear is that when workers depend on their bosses for their visas, exploitation is sure to follow.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/corbyn-lays-out-labours-terms-for-backing-may-on-brexit,2019-02-06 00:00:00

Tusk warns of 'special place in hell' for those who backed Brexit without a plan

The European Union’s frustration with the British government has erupted into the open, prompting a vicious war of words across the Channel as Theresa May heads to Brussels to try to salvage her Brexit deal.

Unscripted comments from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, warning of a “special place in hell” for those who pushed for Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan” set off a furious reaction in London.

The comments came just 24 hours before May is due to sit down with Tusk to try and hammer out a way forward. The leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom – a Brexiter – described Tusk’s comments as “spiteful”.

“I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful,” she said.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “It’s this sort of arrogance that drives antipathy towards the EU. We are a country that upholds the result of democratic votes. Our EU partners need to respect that.”

The home secretary, Sajid Javid, tweeted that Tusk’s remarks were “out of order”.

Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, condemned Tusk for being “deliberately provocative [and] very disrespectful”. DUP MP Sammy Wilson described the EU leader as a “devilish Euro-maniac”.

A spokesman for May said: “I think it is a question for Donald Tusk as to whether he considers the use of that kind of language to be helpful. I appreciate that was difficult this morning as he didn’t take any questions.”

The row threatens to poison an already tense day of meetings for the prime minister, who is due to hold talks with Tusk, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt.

Verhofstadt tweeted of the Brexiters: “Well, I doubt Lucifer would welcome them, as after what they did to Britain, they would even manage to divide hell.”

It will be the first time May meets the EU’s most senior officials since her withdrawal agreement was rejected in the House of Commons last month by an historic 230 votes.

May is seeking “alternative arrangements” to replace the Irish backstop, a time-limit on the customs union it envisages or a unilateral exit mechanism.

But following meetings with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in Brussels, Tusk and Juncker both resolutely rejected any change to the backstop.

A special place in hell? Donald Tusk didn’t go far enough | Martin Kettle Read more

Tusk told reporters that the EU was not “making any new offer” to Britain, and demanded a “realistic” suggestion from May on how to end the impasse.

Juncker said that May already knew before arriving in Brussels that the EU would not reopen discussions on the backstop.

“The so-called alternative arrangements can never replace the backstop,” Juncker added.

“There is no way you can have a unilateral jumping out of the backstop because the backstop is needed as a guarantee. A safety net is not a safety net if it can be destroyed by the unilateral action of one party.”

A photograph was later circulated of Juncker and Varadkar reading a card from a family in Dublin, thanking the EU for its solidarity.

“For the 1st time ever Ireland is stronger [than] Britain,” the card read. “That strength comes not from guns … it comes from your word and that of your colleagues. Britain does not care about peace in Northern Ireland. To them it’s a nuisance.”

During his press conference with Varadkar, Tusk also claimed there was a void of leadership at the heart of the remain movement and appeared to lament Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s failure to back moves towards a second referendum.

“At the moment, the pro-Brexit stance of the UK prime minister, and the leader of the opposition, rules out this question,” Tusk said. “Today, there is no political force and no effective leadership for remain. I say this without satisfaction, but you can’t argue with the facts.”

Varadkar expressed a widespread view in Brussels that “the instability in British politics in recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable that we know will work, will last”.

Varadkar, who is due to have dinner with May on Friday, said the EU had been flexible throughout: “Perhaps it’s for those who have created the problem to be creative now.”

Asked about May’s ambitions for coming to Brussels, Varadkar said: “I do have a concern around this idea of alternative arrangements.

“We need to bear in mind that this majority that perhaps existed or did exist in the House of Commons for alternative arrangements probably only existed because alternative arrangements can mean whatever you want them to mean.

“I don’t believe that would have passed if people actually had to get into the detail.”

Varadkar was also picked up by microphones telling Tusk that the British will “give you terrible trouble”, to which the former Polish prime minister laughed and nodded.

Sources close to Tusk, who held an “open and frank” telephone call with May last week, said the comments had been “from the heart”.

May’s visit has been described as “part of a process” by No 10 and she is expected to arrive in Brussels without having narrowed down which of three proposed approaches she hopes to pursue – an end-date to the backstop; a unilateral exit clause; or hi-tech alternatives to border checks.

“We are continuing to work on all three,” the prime minister’s spokesman said on Wednesday.

May has promised to bring a reworked withdrawal agreement back for MPs to approve “as soon as possible”; but senior government sources suggested that was unlikely to be next week.

Asked whether he agreed with Tusk’s comments about the Brexiters, Juncker had told reporters: “I believe in heaven and I have never seen hell, apart from the time I was doing my job here. It’s a hell.”

David Davis: An ardent Brexiter from the first hour, Theresa May’s bluff and blustering first Brexit secretary was nonetheless so blissfully ignorant of the EU’s workings that he promised, a month before the referendum in June 2016, that Britain would be able to negotiate individual trade deals with Germany, France, Italy and Poland (the EU, as the government has since learned, negotiates collectively). Within minutes of a vote for Brexit, Davis predicted, German CEOs would be “knocking down Chancellor Merkel’s door demanding access to the British market”. Davis also reckoned that within a couple of years, “before anything material has changed, we can negotiate a free trade area massively bigger than the EU”, blithely assuring the House of Commons in October 2016 that there “will be no downside to Brexit, only a considerable upside”. If you have “a good eye and a steady hand, it’s easy enough”, he said. 4/5

Boris Johnson: One of the prime promoters of the sunlit, unicorn-rich uplands that await once Britain has freed itself from the shackles of an EU on the brink of collapse, the former foreign secretary pledged Brexit would permit “continued free trade and access to the single market” while allowing the UK to “take back control of huge sums of money, £350m a week, and spend it on our priorioties such as the NHS”. The cost of leaving “would be virtually nil, and the cost of staying would be very high”, he observed during the referendum campaign. And of companies’ more practical concerns about the possible impact on their bottom line, he reportedly observed: “Fuck business.” Brexit, Johnson proclaimed – quoting Shakespeare’s Brutus – was a time for Britain “not to fight against the tide of history, but to take that tide at the flood and sail on to fortune”. 5/5

Brexit would leave Britain absolutely “free to cooperate and trade with our European neighbours”, Farage promised, while “taking back control of our own destiny as a nation and being free to blaze our own trail in the world”.

theguardian,Blackface past and sexual assault claim threaten Virginia's top three officials,"['Ben Jacobs', 'Richard Wolffe']","The political crisis in Virginia escalated dramatically on Wednesday when the state’s attorney general confessed to putting on blackface in the 1980s and a woman went public with detailed allegations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor.

With Governor Ralph Northam’s career already hanging by a thread over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook, the day’s developments threatened to take down Virginia’s top three elected officials, all of them Democrats.

The twin blows began with the attorney general, Mark Herring, issuing a statement saying he had worn brown makeup and a wig in 1980 to look like a rapper during a party as a 19-year-old student at the University of Virginia.

Herring, who has been among those calling on Northam to resign, said he was “deeply, deeply sorry for the pain that I cause with this revelation”. He said that in the days ahead, “honest conversations and discussions will make it clear whether I can or should continue to serve as attorney general”.

Then, within hours, Vanessa Tyson, the woman whose sexual assault allegations against the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, surfaced earlier this week, issued a detailed statement saying Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room in 2004 during the Democratic national convention in Boston.

Tyson, a 42-year-old political scientist who is on a fellowship at Stanford University and specializes in the political discourse of sexual assault, said she was not motivated by politics to come forward, writing: “I am a proud Democrat.”

Fairfax, who is line to become governor if Northam resigns, has repeatedly denied her allegations, saying that the encounter was consensual and that he is the victim of a strategically timed political smear.

“At no time did she express to me any discomfort or concern about our interactions, neither during that encounter, nor during the months following it, when she stayed in touch with me, nor the past 15 years,” he said in a statement.

Herring, 57, went public after rumors of a blackface photo of him had circulated at the capitol for a day or more. But in his statement, he said nothing about the existence of a photo.

Herring made a name for himself nationally by playing a central role in getting Virginia’s ban on gay marriage lifted, and he had been planning to run for governor in 2021.

The chairman of the Virginia legislative black caucus, Lamont Bagby, said its members needed time to process the news about the attorney general: “We’ve got a lot to digest.”

In his statement, Herring said he and two friends had dressed up to look like rappers they listened to, including Kurtis Blow, admitting: “It sounds ridiculous even now writing it.

“That conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others,” he said.

But he also said: “This conduct is in no way reflective of the man I have become in the nearly 40 years since.”

Northam has come under pressure from nearly the entire state and national Democratic establishment to resign after the discovery of a photo on his profile page in the Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook of someone in blackface standing next to a person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe.

Northam admitted at first that he was in the photo without saying which costume he was wearing. A day later, he denied he was in the picture. But he acknowledged he once used shoe polish to blacken his face and look like Michael Jackson at a dance contest in Texas in 1984, when he was in the army.

Last Friday, Herring condemned the yearbook photo as “indefensible” and said that it was “no longer possible” for Northam to lead the state.

theguardian,Questions over lifestyle of Putin's aide and his wife's $10m property empire,"['Luke Harding', 'Jon Swaine']","The wife of Vladimir Putin’s press spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has accumulated a property empire worth well over $10m (£7.7m) and is designing a riverside palace on an exclusive Moscow estate, the Guardian can reveal.

The project is being overseen by a Russian tycoon who has previously done business with Donald Trump, documents show.

The disclosures are likely to raise fresh questions about Peskov’s wealth and how he and his wife, Tatiana Navka, seem able to afford a super-affluent lifestyle.

Russian opposition leaders have repeatedly criticised Peskov’s lifestyle since his celebrity wedding in 2015 to Navka, a champion ice dancer who won gold for Russia in the 2006 Winter Olympics. A Russian citizen, she lived and trained for more than a decade in the US.

Though wealthy in her own right, research led by the investigative unit Dossier Center, together with the Guardian, suggests the couple’s assets and spending are greater than has been reported.

In October 2014, Navka bought a state-of-the-art property in Rublyovka, the forested area west of Moscow that is home to Putin, Russia’s president, and many from the country’s ruling elite.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Documents show Tatiana Navka’s purchased the entire plot in Tretya Okhota for 300m roubles

The house in the village of Tretya Okhota is built on some of the most expensive real estate in Russia. In December 2012, it was offered for sale at $15.6m.

But documents seen by the Guardian show Navka purchased the entire plot in October 2014 for 300m roubles ($7.1m) – an $8.5m discount. The price included two pieces of land costing $3.5m. Navka furnished the house in 2013-15, consulting her husband on everything from gym equipment to choice of eco-sauna. Items ordered from a Cyprus boutique cost more than €500,000.

The property’s seller is listed as Timur Khaldarov, a little-known figure who ran a charitable sporting and arts foundation, according to Russian media.

The foundation’s founder is Alisher Usmanov, one of Russia’s most powerful and politically influential oligarchs. Usmanov was until recently a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and in 2018 the UK’s eighth richest man.

Khaldarov said he was independently wealthy. He works for Metalloinvest, Usmanov’s mining company. He said he met Navka before her second marriage to Peskov, when his daughter wanted to try figure skating. He said he could not remember the name of the acquaintance who introduced them.

The house was “too small” for his family, and so he sold it to Navka in a falling market, he said. “There was no special discount. I was paid the market value. Why consider it a gift?” he added. Usmanov, his boss, was not aware of the deal and did not influence it, he told Moscow TV channel Rain.

Navka said she bought the property at the market rate, at a time when real estate prices “began to plummet”. She was unaware of the 2012 price. “I have been working for a long time. I earn money and pay taxes on it. Everything else is my personal matter,” she said in an email.

Neither she nor her husband had a “business relationship” with any of Russia’s “major entrepreneurs”, she added.

Usmanov confirmed he “worked closely” with Khaldarov but said he had no interest in the Tretya Okhota house or knowledge of transactions. There were “well-known fluctuations” in the Moscow property market at the time, he said.

According to Dossier, Peskov and Navka made plans for an even grander mansion on an exclusive plot in the Moscow region belonging to the tycoon and developer Aras Agalarov.

In March 2018, Agalarov personally approved the building proposal, on a site called Rechnaya #27, documents show. The plot is situated inside a gated housing estate for Russia’s ultra-wealthy, on the bank of a river, and featuring a golf course and private beach.

Documents show in 2017 the couple hired a firm of American architects, Zampolin & Associates, based in Westwood, New Jersey, to draw up a new mini-palace known as the Yanavka Residence.

The firm’s founder, Bob Zampolin, flew to Moscow to discuss the designs with Navka. His proposal features 2,400 metres of living space, a separate entrance for staff, a pool, spa, hot tub, sauna, great room and library.

The project was active in mid-2018. Its current status is unclear. Last week, there was no sign of building work. Asked if the plan was going ahead, Navka replied: “This does not concern you.” She said her relationship with Zampolin was personal and “wasn’t connected with plans to acquire property anywhere”.

Navka’s latest photoshoot for a Russian magazine took place at the Agalarov Estate hotel.

The revelations are likely to provoke fresh questions over Peskov’s wealth and any potential benefits he and his wife have gained from his close relationship with Putin.

Dossier is funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an exiled critic of Putin. Its revelations will fuel questions about Navka’s finances.

Since winning Olympic gold, Navka has enjoyed lucrative TV and advertising deals, including for a brand of yoghurt. She has had a primetime ice dancing show on Russia’s state-run pro-Kremlin Channel One.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tatiana Navka’s property in Tretya Okhota is built on some of the most expensive real estate in Russia

She appears to have bought her Rubylovka property using a 300m-rouble private loan – the entire purchase price. Asked about the loan, Navka repeated: “This does not concern you.”

Before the sale in February 2014, Navka opened three Swiss bank accounts, documents show. The accounts were with the Zurich branch of the Banque Internationale à Luxembourg and in dollars, euros and roubles.

She also set up an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven. The company, Carina Global Assets, was named in the Panama Papers leak.

At that time Navka denied having any offshore companies or accounts: “I don’t know who could have done it. I would like myself to understand what happened.”

Navka also has a portfolio of other high-end properties. They include an elite flat in Moscow’s central Yakimanka district, worth $4m, and given to her by the state as a reward for her sporting success. It is being extensively revamped.

She also has a $2m flat in the Moscow suburb of Polyanka. In 2015, she acquired a property under a lease of 49 years from the Moscow city government.

The pavilion in a Soviet-era park known as VDNkH was to be developed into an ice rink and sporting arena. The project was never implemented, Navka said. She also owns a small flat in the Crimean resort of Yalta.

The couple both have children from previous relationships, and a daughter born in August 2014. They have had family holidays in the Maldives, Dubai, and the French ski resort of Courchevel.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has expressed concerns over the couple’s spending. Photograph: AP

Their spending has come under persistent questioning from Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader. In 2015, he accused Peskov of “illegal enrichment” after he and Navka reportedly honeymooned on the world’s most expensive yacht.

Peskov was spotted at his wedding ceremony in Sochi wearing a $625,000 watch. Peskov said the watch was a present from his bride. He also received an inheritance, he said.

Navalny has urged the Kremlin to examine the apparent discrepancy between Peskov’s official income and his ostentatious spending, so far without success. One theory is that Navka has on occasions benefited from her husband’s links to Russian oligarchs who are supportive of Putin.

Navalny has previously alleged that Usmanov used a charitable foundation to gift Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s prime minister, an $85m mega-villa in greater Moscow. Usmanov vehemently denies this.

Khaldarov said Navka had rented his former home for a year and a half before she bought it, paying all appropriate taxes. Khaldarov was a deputy director of Usmanov’s Art, Science and Sport charity foundation.

Peskov has been a confidant of Putin for 20 years and is regarded as one of the most powerful people in Russia. He was involved in discussions over a property deal in Moscow, held with Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has admitted he lied about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

Cohen told Congress the plan fizzled out in January 2016. He now says discussions went on for another six months and included a possible trip by Trump to Moscow.

Cohen emailed Peskov asking for help – and held a 20-minute phone call with one of his assistants. Peskov later invited Cohen to the St Petersburg economic forum, and offered to facilitate high-level meetings with Putin and Medvedev.

Peskov and Agalarov appear in the dossier compiled by the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele. It alleges the Kremlin holds compromising material on Trump, some of it allegedly collected during Trump’s 2013 visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe contest, which Agalarov hosted. Agalarov paid Trump about $14m in fees for putting on the show. Trump owned the rights.

The dossier says Peskov was in charge of kompromat on Trump and Hillary Clinton, as part of Moscow’s wider effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election in Trump’s favour.

theguardian,Germany's cabinet approves revision to Nazi-era abortion law,['Emily Schultheis'],"Germany’s cabinet has approved a revision to the country’s controversial, Nazi-era abortion law, a move that – pending parliamentary approval – would allow doctors and medical associations to provide women with more information about where and how to seek abortions.

Under the current law – paragraph 219a of Germany’s criminal code – doctors are prohibited from advertising abortion services or providing information about abortions on their websites. German law allows abortions during the first trimester, but uses various measures, such as the advertising ban, which came into force in 1933, to in effect discourage women from obtaining them.

Should the Bundestag pass the revisions that were approved on Wednesday, doctors would be able to inform patients that they performed abortions, while the German Medical Association would also be allowed to compile a list of doctors and hospitals that offered the procedure. In addition, doctors would be able to link to further information and online resources about abortion procedures.

German parties reach deal on softening Nazi-era abortion law Read more

The current debate about the provision was revived last year when the gynaecologist Dr Kristina Hänel was fined €6,000 (£5,200) for listing abortion services on her website and providing information about the procedure. Hänel, who has since become a vocal opponent of the law, vowed to fight her charges to the country’s highest court if need be.

Conservatives within Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union wanted the law to stay on the books, arguing it helped discourage women who might be undecided from going through with terminating a pregnancy. But the centre-left Social Democrats, as well as the Greens and Left parties, have called the law outdated and for it to be scrapped entirely.

In addition to the changes regarding information about abortions, the compromise would raise the age for which insurance companies must provide free contraceptives from 20 to 22.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/germany-cabinet-approve-revision-nazi-era-abortion-law-paragraph-219a-doctor-advertising-ban,2019-02-06 00:00:00

The doctor who signed his death certificate tells CNN he has suspicions about the swiftness of Brown’s deterioration, especially after his condition had improved the previous day. “He changed too fast,” Marvin Crawford says. “He was a patient I would never have predicted would have coded ... But he died that night, and I did raise that question: What went wrong in that room?” Crawford says a nurse told him drug residue was found in a tube helping Brown to breathe, and says “somebody perhaps could have given him an illicit substance that led to his death”.

“There are legitimate questions about James Brown’s death that can only be answered by an autopsy and a criminal investigation,” writes CNN journalist Thomas Lake, who says 11 people told him that Brown’s death should be reinvestigated, adding to Brown’s late daughter LaRhonda Pettit and son-in-law Darren Lumar, who, before they died, also alleged Brown was killed.

They include Brown’s fourth wife Tomi Rae, Brown’s manager Frank Copsidas, and Daryl Brown, one of six heirs named in Brown’s will. And Reverend Al Sharpton, a friend of the singer, told Lake: “I’ve always had and still have a lot of questions … I wouldn’t mind a further investigation at all.”

Jacqueline Hollander, who amassed much of the evidence that points towards a possible murder, told Lake that her friend Adrienne Brown said she was forced to drop charges against her husband, of assault with intent to murder, after being intimidated by men working for Brown. Adrienne later made further allegations of domestic violence against Brown, but died before Brown could be tried.

Adrienne Brown’s official cause of death, in 1996, was an accidental overdose of painkillers following plastic surgery. But Lake hears from detective Steve Miller, who investigated Adrienne’s death, that a police informant, writing in a notebook seen by Lake, claimed Adrienne was murdered.

Hollander also told Lake that Brown had raped her, and threatened to have her killed if she told anyone about the assault. Seven people corroborated Hollander’s account that she was also covertly surveilled by Brown for years.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/06/james-brown-death-investigate-murder-claims,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,Bank sewer burglars left gold bars strewn across vault floor,['Daniel Boffey'],"Man, 27, held over Antwerp bank raid as details emerge of thieves making off hastily after alarm sounded

Burglars who broke into a bank in Antwerp’s diamond quarter by crawling through tunnels and a sewage pipe left gold bars strewn across the floor of the main vault after apparently being disturbed during the raid.

They also left behind vital clues including a mattress, extension cables, pneumatic hammers and a grinding wheel that has been traced through its serial number to a shop in the Netherlands.

The men are believed to have been disturbed by the building’s alarm but escaped while the police waited for employees to open the secure door to the vault.

Once inside, the officers were unable to enter the escape tunnel until breathing equipment was brought in.

The public prosecutor has confirmed that a 27-year-old man, who was born in Georgia but has Belgian nationality, was arrested on Tuesday and is due to appear before judges on Friday in relation to the burglary of the BNP Paribas Fortis branch on Sunday.

Sahil Malik, the lawyer for the suspect, declined to comment apart from saying: “We will do our story Friday in front of the council chamber.”

The thieves are understood to have started out in a nearby flat from where they dug a four-metre (13ft) long tunnel nearly two metres below the surface to connect with a sewage pipe.

They then crawled for hundreds of metres in the sewage works before tunnelling again to resurface in the bank.

CCTV images appear to show that the raid involved three men, who left the bank with heavily stuffed black bags on their backs.

But it appears that they were disturbed by a burglar alarm in the vaults. Only 20 to 30 of more than a thousand safety deposit boxes held by the bank had been emptied by the time police arrived to find bars of gold left on the vault’s floor.

The gang, two of whom were said to have spoken in broken English, had leased the basement flat from where they dug their first tunnel under the name Mark Buchman. Police found a pile of bags of sand in the bedroom.

The bank is on the edge of a square mile that is the largest diamond district in the world, boasting an annual turnover of £42bn. It was the scene of the “heist of the century” in 2003, when more than £75m in jewels was stolen from a vault.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/bank-sewage-burglars-left-gold-bars-strewn-across-vault-floor,2019-02-06 00:00:00

theguardian,Almaty spills its secrets: lost Soviet art discovered behind wall,[],"When Jama Nurkalieva and a small group of colleagues conducted a site survey of a disused Soviet-era panoramic cinema in Almaty, the former capital of Kazakhstan, they had no idea what lay behind the internal plasterboard wall that faces out towards the street – until someone spotted a narrow gap.

As the caretaker shined a light into the darkness behind, the group caught a glimpse of a man’s head. Out came the toolbox and the rest of the artwork was slowly revealed: a Soviet-era sgraffito by the graphic artist Eugeny Sidorkin that had been lost and forgotten for decades.

From the Italian graffiare, to scratch, sgraffito is a technique that involves placing one layer of plaster or cement over another, and then scratching through the superficial layer to reveal contours or patterns beneath.

Discovery of the hidden Sidorkin sgraffito

Built to a standardised design in 1964, the cinema was one of the largest in the USSR. It was fronted entirely by large panels of glass that offered an unobstructed view of the sgraffito to passersby.

Now the former cinema is being repurposed as the Tselinny Centre of Contemporary Culture. The discovery of a work by Sidorkin – honoured as People’s Artist of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic before his death in 1982 – is particularly exciting, says centre director Nurkalieva. The sgraffito is being brought back to its former glory by restoration experts, along with the architect Asif Khan and Sidorkin’s son Vadim, an artist.

The sgraffito was not the only Soviet-era art uncovered in Almaty last year. Dennis Keen, founder of the Monumental Almaty website, uncovered a 1984 mosaic of Lenin at the Kazakhstan Academy of Science in September. The work, by Vladimir Tverdokhlebov and a team of artists, had been boarded up for more than 20 years.

“There is a major interest in Soviet imagery and especially Lenin,” says Keen, but the mosaic will be hidden from public gaze by a curtain on account of its political sensitivity. Students and visitors will only be able to view it by arrangement.

In some post-Soviet cities outside Russia, communist symbols have been outlawed. Ukraine passed laws in 2015 that prohibit communist symbols from being displayed in public places, with up to 10 years in prison for those who flout the rules, and sanctions the symbols’ removal. Soviet-era mosaics that depict folklore, science and sport are exempt, but two political works, Lenin and Science, in the city of Kharkiv, and Always With Lenin, in Lysychansk, were torn down the following year.

Yevgen Nikiforov, author of Decommunized: Ukrainian Soviet Mosaics, estimates that up to 4% of Ukraine’s mosaics have been removed or covered since the law was introduced.

In Almaty, Keen estimates that around a third of the city’s Soviet-era artworks have been lost. What survives are largely mosaics, reliefs and sgraffiti, which, unlike painted murals and posters, endure well against the elements.

While there is little incentive now to cover or remove Soviet-era artworks depicting folklore and natural landscapes, they were sometimes controversial in their day due to supposed hidden meanings.

Ekaterina Golovatyuk, curator of an exhibition on Soviet modernist architecture at the Tselinny, recounts an anecdote in which an architect and an artist worked together to create a mosaic for a cafe. It was a straightforward depiction of a lake with a tiger on one side and goats on the other. “The [local communist] party was asking them, ‘What’s the meaning of this?’ They were saying, ‘Nothing, it’s just a natural landscape’ – but they couldn’t convince them that there was no hidden political message.”

Golovatyuk believes Almaty has as many surviving mosaics as it does because Kazakhstan’s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, changed the country’s capital from Almaty to Astana in 1997.

Missing murals: the lost Soviet art of the Stans Read more

With much of the country’s subsequent investment and development directed at this new “city of the steppes”, Almaty escaped relatively unchanged.

“Nazarbayev wanted to have a clean ground to express his ideology and to experiment with architecture, so Almaty was left alone,” says Golovatyuk. “It has been its biggest fortune in a way, because otherwise I think there would have been much more damage, and many more things would have been lost.”

'We have to learn to live with floods': waterlogged Surat to become latest megacity

'We have to learn to live with floods': waterlogged Surat to become latest megacity

Look up as you walk around Surat and you might spot “HFL 8.8.2006” daubed in red paint on a wall above your head. HFL stands for “high flood level”, and the inscriptions are 15 feet above the ground in places – a fading memory of the devastating floods of August 2006, which killed 150 people, according to official estimates (unofficial counts put the death toll at over 500). More than 60% of the city was underwater and damage was estimated at $2bn.

Surat’s geography – it lies at the mouth of the Tapi river, near the Arabian Sea – makes it prone to flooding, and it experiences a major inundation every four years on average.

But that threat does not stop people moving here, drawn by the hope of work in Surat’s textile and diamond industries, and the population has soared from 2.4 million in 2001 to around 6.6 million today. The UN estimates the city will be home to 10 million people by 2032, making it India’s eighth megacity, after Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Chennai and newcomers Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.

Q&A Where are the next 15 megacities? Show Hide By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Guardian Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda; from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City. We'll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi'an, Seoul, Wuhan and London. Read more from the next 15 megacities series here.

Surat, known as the “diamond city”, faces a triple flooding threat: from the Tapi and the Ukai dam upstream, from the Arabian Sea, and from the 19 miles of creeks that spread through the city. It constructed its first flood wall in 1664, and the battle to hold back water has been raging ever since. Climate change has only exacerbated the situation.

Ayesha Ansari is drying clothes near her one-room house beside the Mithi, one of six major creeks in Surat. She says her neighbourhood is submerged in knee-deep water most monsoons. “It is a nightmare, with the stinky sewage water gushing through the narrow lanes,” she says.

Now the creeks are being remodelled. The sound of workmen welding metal rods for reinforced concrete banks reverberates through the tranquil afternoon. “A retaining wall will channel the flow,” says Maulik Rao, the official in charge of the scheme. “There will be a biodiversity park too, with a garden, a pool and a cycle track.”

Some of the funding for the remodelling comes from Surat’s Smart City initiative, part of a national government scheme launched in 2015 in 100 cities. The city is spending around £300m on projects including the live-tracking of buses, new water treatment plants, solar and biogas generation, and automated LED street lights.

The Tapi poses an even bigger risk. After floods in 1968 the government built the Ukai dam upstream with the aim of managing the flow of water to Surat while also generating hydroelectric power and irrigating farmland – but these different priorities are often in conflict, says Gopalakrishna Bhat, the chair of Taru Leading Edge, a consultancy and think tank.

“The dam is supposed to generate power as well as control floods,” he says. “To generate more power you have to keep the water level as high as possible. To control floods, you have to keep a cushion, and not fill the dam fully. Dam managers struggle to manage these objectives.

“Today, the dam has become the water source for many cities and industries. The pressure of maintaining maximum storage from the dam is far greater.”

The expansion of the city is making matters worse. Since the last big floods in 2006, Surat’s geographical area has almost tripled to 326 sq km (126 sq miles).

“The city used to exist only on one side of the river,” Bhat says, “but it is now expanding on both sides, and there is little flood plain left.”

After the devastating floods of 2006, the municipal government set up an early warning system and started work building an embankment for the river. “The fire department does mock evacuation drills with schools and other institutions,” says the, municipal commissioner M Thennarasan. “Our website and mobile app have details of the water level in the Ukai dam. In case of an emergency, we can push warning messages to the people of Surat.”

These measures were put to the test in 2013 when the early warning system predicted heavy rain when the dam was already full. “Because we had an early idea, we decided to deplete the dam two days before the rainfall was expected,” says Chaitanya Bhat, deputy municipal commissioner. “Otherwise the dam authorities would have been compelled to release water and the city would have been flooded.” Disaster was averted.

Indian city of Surat anticipates worst effects of climate change Read more

But Gopalakrishna Bhat says Surat will only face ever bigger risks. In a 2013 paper he predicted the number of days with more than 200mm of rainfall would increase. “This would lead to the need for a greater number of emergency releases from the dam reservoir and increase the frequency and intensity of floods in Surat,” he says.

“It is estimated that around 90% of Surat’s geographical area is affected by some type of climate hazard – whether flooding, coastal storms and cyclones or inundation associated with high tides and sea level rise. Much of the city and its surrounds are less than 10 metres above mean sea level.”

The dangers are compounded by the rapid expansion of Hazira, a port 15 miles from Surat built on reclaimed sections of flood plain, which has triggered major hydrological changes. The port has effectively narrowed the mouth of the Tapi where it meets the sea. “The large-scale industrial development at the mouth of the river causes a rise in the water level immediately upstream,” Bhat’s paper noted.

The city has reached the stage where it must accept that future floods are inevitable, Bhat says. “We have to learn to live with the floods, and manage them in a way so our life is not disturbed too much.”

theguardian,Inside Chengdu: can China's megacity version of the garden city work?,['Lily Kuo'],"The next 15 megacities #13 : It may be China’s most liveable burgeoning megacity, but Chengdu’s park city plans bear a price tag of forced evictions and relocations

“The goal is that every 300 metres you see green,” says Chen Lan, an expert in urban design and planning at Sichuan University in the emerging Chinese megacity of Chengdu. “You open a window, you see green, you see a park …”

With its mild weather, teahouses, quiet leafy streets and internationally known food, Chengdu in south-west China has long been rated one of the country’s most liveable cities.

For much of the city’s 2,000-year history as an administrative and agricultural capital surrounded by good land, Chengdu thrived in relative isolation in China’s hinterlands. Over the last two decades, though, it has experienced a burst of rapid growth, fuelled by Beijing’s “Go West” policy encouraging development in interior cities.

Q&A Where are the next 15 megacities? Show Hide By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48.

In 1998 the city was home to 4.2 million people, according to United Nations estimates. With migrants pouring in from other parts of the province, that figure is now 8.8 million, and the latest UN forecasts predict more than 10 million will live in the urban agglomeration by 2026. Official Chinese data, which tends to include rural areas too, puts the current population at 16 million.

To deal with that growth, Chengdu city planners have made environmental protection a focus. Some liken the programme to England’s garden city movement, which emerged in the 1890s to counteract urban crowding and pollution.

But Chengdu’s urban renewal campaigns, like those of many Chinese cities, have resulted in mass demolitions and relocations – and critics say these projects are more about local officials inflating economic statics, impressing Beijing to climb up the party ladder, and creating a pretext for transferring public funds into private hands.

City of gardens, city of parks

Rather than building parks in a city, the idea is to build a city within a park, according to Chen. By 2050, Chengdu will be home to what local officials say will be the world’s largest network of paths for people to walk or bike. The Tianfu Greenway is planned to stretch 16,900km around the city, and will be linked to hundreds of parks, gardens and protected “ecological zones”, enveloping Chengdu in one massive garden. Some 1,585km had been completed by August last year.

Existing parks will be expanded. Highways, flyovers and bridges will be “greened” with flowers and plants. One of the new parks, the Longquan City Forest Park to the east of Chengdu, will be among the world’s largest, spanning an area of 1,275 sq km when it is completed in 2035.

Officials are also trying to preserve the rural outskirts of Chengdu. By 2022, 1,000 farming villages, known as linpan, will be protected. Decades of urbanisation have emptied out these ancient agricultural settlements, which are unique to the region.

“Chengdu is one of the most advanced cities in China – it’s one of the ones that are making environmental protection, public space and quality of life as the agenda,” says Salvatore Fundaro of the urban planning and design branch of the UN Human Settlements Programme, who has been working on projects in Chengdu.

The goal of these projects is to help Chengdu compete with major Chinese cities like Beijing or Shanghai while protecting it from the kind of urbanisation and development that has stripped some Chinese cities of their character. Chengdu, an early centre of Taoism, is known for preserving Chinese traditions in a way other urban centres have not.

Chengdu’s campaigns have gone through various iterations and names – “garden city”, “rural-city reunification” and now “park city” – but their various iterations have always been inextricably linked with politics.

Li Chuncheng, the former mayor and a top party official, first promoted the idea of Chengdu as a “World Modern Garden City” in the early 2000s. After he was arrested in 2012 over corruption, the term “garden city” fell out of favour.

Last year, China’s president, Xi Jinping, visited Chengdu and praised the concept of the gongyuan chengshi, or “park city”. Since then Chengdu officials have accelerated the project.

“Every word of ‘gongyuan chengshi’ has its meaning,” Huang Wei, of the department of major projects and public facilities of Tianfu New Area, one of the city’s new districts, told Chinese media in September.

“‘Gong’ indicates something everyone can share; ‘yuan’ refers to ecology ...; ‘cheng’ means the place to live with functions like transport, healthcare and education; and ‘shi’ represents production, a driving force for a city’s development.”

But this development has consequences. One of Li Chuncheng’s nicknames was Li Chaicheng, a play on his name that means “tear down the city”.

“There wasn’t any attention paid to the needs of the people and how these projects could positively affect people’s lives,” says Jiang Xueqin, a Chengdu-based writer and expert on education.

“Just because Chengdu puts up an international arts centre doesn’t mean international artists will come to perform and people will become more cosmopolitan and sophisticated. Urban planning really ought to be about improving public spaces so that people interact with each other more.”

Local residents have also been a casualty of the “park city” push. Zhou Wenming, 48, is the last holdout among more than a dozen families who have been persuaded to leave an area on the eastern side of the city that developers are turning into a park.

It is already under construction, with mounds of dirt jutting into the small garden that he and his elderly parents use to grow vegetables. His plot of land, which has been in his family for at least four generations, will be turned into a basketball court.

“This has nothing to do with the people,” he says. “It only benefits the property companies who build houses on or around this land. It doesn’t benefit the people at all.”

Zhou is not opposed to leaving as long as legal procedures are followed, like providing residents with legal documents and compensation. So far, local authorities appear to be using pressure to intimidate his family into leaving. Last year, when he travelled to Beijing to petition against the eviction, his wife was slashed by a man on a motorbike. Their windows are regularly broken at night.

Many evictions and relocations happen without the buy-in of local residents. In Fujia village, in the south of the city, parts of the district are due to be torn down by June this year for construction of a greenway. Yet few residents have heard of the plan. Many are resigned to leaving, and some have already been relocated once before.

“If we have to leave, we leave. There’s nothing we can do,” says one woman, standing outside a mahjong parlour she runs. Across the road is a driving school and next door is a hair salon. Although most of the people here are waidi ren, from outside Chengdu, almost everyone on this street has been here for the last 10 years.

“Of course it will be hard for us,” says the woman, who asked not to give her name for fear of retribution from local officials.

‘Wherever there is empty land, people will farm it’

Many residents, though, say Chengdu is one of few cities in China where officials have made a concerted effort to improve the quality of life. People there have access to affordable housing, a good public school system, and quality medical care, according to Jiang.

The streets are lined with trees and clearly marked bike lanes. Even in mid-December, retirees, parents and children are using neighbourhood parks and walkways. In the larger parks, such as Renmin Park, locals sit in public areas playing chess and drinking tea. Tourists come year-round to visit the city’s famous panda breeding centre.

In other ways, Chengdu could do more to take advantage of greenery and public spaces residents have already created. Throughout the city there are seemingly random gardens between buildings, strips of land by the side of the road and other unoccupied areas.

Local residents, many of them farmers who moved to the city, farm any unused land, growing produce to sell or eat themselves. They organise the land themselves, and everyone sticks to their own plots. “Wherever there is empty land, people will farm it,” says Chen.

Some of these ad hoc gardens are close to part of Chengdu’s greenbelt project, the Panda Greenway, a sidewalk running next to the Third Ring Road, a major traffic artery. Cars and trucks whizz past.

The only pedestrian around is Zhang Xiuhua, an elderly woman walking by the gardens. She rarely ventures as far as the greenway because of the dust and pollution from the cars. She was once a farmer, and moved to Chengdu to be with her daughter who works at the local university.

The gardens have been fenced in, a sign they will be torn down. Down the road, green netting has been thrown over another garden. It too will be turned into a park, she has heard.

Zhang believes replacing these garden areas with high-rises and parks is a good thing. “Development is good for a city,” she says. Asked why, she pauses, looking at the gardens. “I don’t know, actually.”

theguardian,Lisbon's bad week: police brutality reveals Portugal's urban reality,['Ana Naomi De Sousa'],"From time to time, cars of curious people drive slowly though Bairro da Jamaica, craning their necks for a peek at the neighbourhood that’s been in the headlines across Portugal for several days now. None of them step out of their vehicles.

They’re here to look at the broken glass, the smashed roof tiles and the evidence of last week’s violence. The tallest of the bairro’s self-built housing towers is now derelict, fenced off with yellow tape and awaiting demolition; the others are also scheduled to be torn down, but are still occupied for now.

“Most of the residents here are just regular people: they go to school, they work, they pay their bills, they pay taxes, they contribute to society like everyone else,” says Liliana Jordão, 27, a resident of this neighbourhood on the southern outskirts of greater Lisbon. “But if Bairro da Jamaica already had a really bad reputation, this week it’s been like a zoo.”

It began last week with a scrap between two residents, but it was when the police arrived that the real story kicked off: officers were captured on video beating, pushing and dragging anyone who came into their path.

Filmed by local residents, the video quickly went viral on social media, spreading across the estates and neighbourhoods of the city’s peripheries, where most of Portugal’s black, Afro-descendent population resides.

“When I saw the video, the way they treated those women, I actually wept,” says Jordão. “It could easily have been my mother. And then I thought to myself, no, enough is enough, I have to do something”.

This is where the segregation of Portuguese-speaking African immigrants and subsequent generations began Antonio Brito Guterres

The following day around 300 people, most of them young, black residents of Lisbon’s suburbs, held a spontaneous demonstration in the centre of the city chanting “Stop racist police brutality”. Police responded by firing rubber bullets towards the protesters, with the confrontations resulting in four arrests. Tensions rose from there, with police spokespeople and unions trading accusations of excessive force and institutional racism.

Across the suburbs cars have been set on fire and police stations targeted, as the original call to protest – “There are many Jamaicas” – has echoed across the country, reflecting an urban reality that is rarely discussed in Portugal. .

Shanty towns proliferated in Portugal from the 1960s onwards, the combined result of poor urban planning, large-scale migration from the countryside and immigration from the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe. “African immigrants were pushed into thoroughly precarious conditions, often having to resort to building their own homes, illegally, and on the outskirts of the city,” says Antonio Brito Guterres, an urban social worker. “This is where the segregation of Portuguese-speaking African immigrants and subsequent generations began, from the rest of the city.”

The structural problems in Bairro da Jamaica, approximately 30 years since it was first established, are typical of neglected self-built neighbourhoods: illegal electricity supply, improvised sewage and water arrangements, and inadequate building conditions. “It’s damn cold in the winter and boiling in the summer”, says resident Cândido Guilherme de Almeida Pedro, 29.

After years of being ignored, at the end of 2017 a plan for Bairro da Jamaica was finally agreed as part the national resettlement programme, the PER (Programa Especial de Realojamento). Launched in Portugal in the 1990s to demolish the shanty towns, the PER approach has been defined by replacing self-built housing with concrete housing estates. Critics say it has replaced slums with ghettos. A 2017 report by the UN Special rapporteur on adequate housing raised concerns about the situation of the African descendent and Roma gypsy (cigano) communities in Portugal, flagging living conditions “that directly threaten a dignified life, which is at the centre of the human right to housing.” They also criticised the detrimental effects – including homelessness – of demolitions and evictions instigated by the PER.

“A lot of those neighbourhoods are seen as ‘sensitive zones’ by the security forces”, says Guterres. “But that doesn’t correlate with crime rates. It’s about racial bias within the police.”

We don’t want war with the police. We need to show them, however, that we have rights ... the way they behave needs to change Liliana Jordão

Heavy-handed policing in the suburbs is blamed for the deaths of at least 10 people in the last 15 years – among them 14-year old Elson Sanches in 2009 – and no police officer has ever been convicted in connection with them. Then there is the high profile case, currently in court, in which 17 police agents stand accused by the public prosecutor of a litany of crimes against a number of young black men and women from the self-built neighbourhood of Cova da Moura, including aggravated kidnapping, falsifying testimonies, racial abuse and assault.

Meanwhile, in 2016, a UN report from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination said it remained concerned with racism experienced in Portugal and repeated recommendations that the country adopted specific measures aimed at the African descendent population, who “remain invisible in the most significant positions” in society.

For Almeida Pedro and many others, Monday’s demonstration was a long time coming.

“The protest is to do with a lot of things that have been accumulating for a long time. You have lots of young people who want to be part of society but find themselves totally marginalised. What happened here in the bairro was really the last straw”, he says.

“Of course we don’t want war with the police,” adds Jordão. “We need to show them, however, that we have rights - as much as we have responsibilities - and the way they behave needs to change.”

With the new plan to resettle people across the local area, rather than in a purpose built estate far away, the residents of Bairro da Jamaica hope they will avoid being ghettoised like other communities before them. But with the continued perceived impunity of the police and the apparent unwillingness of Portuguese security forces to even consider the issue of institutionalised racism, the source of tension between African descent communities in the peripheries of Lisbon and the police will remain.

theguardian,"'I'm petrified': 10 years on, Black Saturday trauma still haunts",['Lisa Martin'],"“Half the town is on medication, and the other half should be.”

That’s bushfire survivor Anne Dixon’s dark-humoured attempt to describe how people from the mountain-top hamlets around Kinglake are coping 10 years on from Black Saturday.

The district, north of Melbourne, was the epicentre of the tragedy – 120 lives were lost in the Kilmore-to-Kinglake fire from an overall state toll of 173 on 7 February 2009, with 1,242 homes destroyed.

While trees have grown back and houses have been rebuilt, for many life has never been the same.

Burnt trees are seen among the regrowth on the ridge surrounding Kinglake.

Ahead of the anniversary on Thursday and amid similar dry conditions and a summer heatwave, many from affected Victorian communities are on edge and fragile.

Dixon, who lived in Kinglake for 22 years and lost her home in the fire, takes issue with people saying residents should “get over it”.

“You wouldn’t say that to someone whose entire family died in a car crash,” she says.

“You would be amazed at the number of people who said: ‘Oh, you must be better off now you’ve got a new house’ . It’s not like you moved from your old house to your new house and take everything with you.

“We’ve gone back to the very beginning and had to start over again,” she says. “You’ve got to buy everything, including a blooming bath plug and veggie peeler.”

On Black Saturday, Dixon narrowly escaped in her ute with her hyperventilating cat late in the afternoon.

“I thought, shit, I’m the last moron in Kinglake,” she says now.

Stranded as the fire front came through, Dixon saw the petrol station go up “in one hell of a big bang”.

She sent her daughter Jess a message telling her she loved her and one to family and friends along the lines of: “Stuffed up big time, trapped in car with cat, this is my location.”

Life after the fires was initially so hectic it took a long time for the full impact of the trauma to be felt. Counselling services needed to be extended.

Anne Dixon’s home – before the fires and after.

“In the aftermath you’re busy, finding somewhere to live, buying clothes, sorting out the insurance, if your car was burnt you’re busy trying to get a new one, you’re busy, busy, busy and then you’re busy rebuilding,” Dixon says.

“It takes a few years to stop being busy and to sit down and … start to think back on it.”

In the first few years of fire recovery, Dixon would type her address into Google Earth every few weeks for a glimpse of her beloved weatherboard cottage before it turned to ashes.

Only one photo of her old house was saved – a picture on a snowy winter’s day – but Dixon is philosophical about losing her family’s photo albums dating back to the 1860s.

“My cousin, who is the family historian, lost her son at Marysville. So the pictures really pale in comparison to that.”

Mental health problems

In the first three to four years after the 2009 fires, 26% of people in the worst-affected areas showed signs of mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder, severe psychological distress and depression, a 2016 study found. At the five-year mark, 22% were still dealing with mental health issues.

Data from the federal health department shows an increase of prescriptions for anti-depressants for the statistical area that covers Kinglake and other fire-affected towns, slightly higher than national and Victorian figures.

Whittlesea-based psychologist David Younger has worked with scores of bushfire survivors over the years and still sees patients grappling with PTSD, depression and anxiety, and other trauma symptoms.

“Typically, what happens every summer in the area is some people go into an increased state of high arousal, they become hypervigilant and anxious,” Younger says. This summer’s fires in Tasmania also played on people’s minds, he adds.

For children whose family members died and who lost classmates in the blaze, the past decade has been one of emotional turmoil.

“What I’ve typically seen in adolescents is that the fire event caused significant disruption in their life and in what we would call a normal developmental pathway,” Younger says.

Volunteers Christine Exton and Cheryl Chalmers read up on Black Saturday bushfire information at the Kinglake Historical society museum.

“These could be kids who were so affected by what has happened that they were unable to finish school – they left in year 10 or year 11 and they may not have worked in a substantial employment role since. They’ve come through to me in their 20s wanting to understand what happened and really get their life back on track.”

Christine Exton and Cheryl Chalmers are volunteers at the Kinglake West heritage centre, which will hold an exhibition of photographs and artefacts recovered from the 2009 fires.

“All our kids grew up that day,” Exton says.

“I had my youngest in the car with me and she was trembling and kept saying ‘I don’t want to die mum, I don’t want to die’. I had my hand on her leg to reassure her and then it went orange and black and I said ‘I’ve got to take my hand off your leg and put it on the steering wheel’ and she was like ‘no, no, no, no, no’. She was only 12 … just the fear.”

Chalmers says she has learnt a lot about strategies to support her three children.

“Our son had terrible depression after the fires because he lost his best friend at the age of 10,” she says. “I hate living here, I would move tomorrow if I could.”

But for some, moving away only brought more misfortune.

After losing his home in the fire, Thomas Borg, now 30, relocated to Laidley in Queensland’s Lockyer Valley, only to have his new house get flooded in 2011.

“It didn’t worry me the second time,” he says. “Shit happens.”

He has since moved back to Kinglake and had a relationship breakdown.

“The divorce rate is probably at the highest level … a lot of people have turned to alcohol and drugs … especially marijuana, to cope,” he says.

His mother, Odette Bellamy, lost her home in the blaze, and the properties of two siblings and his father were also burnt out.

Clockwise from top: Survivors Odette Bellamy and son Thomas Borg in the backyard of her home in Kinglake West, which was previously destroyed by the 2009 fires; this statue was all that remained after the Black Saturday bushfire tore through Odette Bellamy’s property.

Bellamy was at a wedding with her youngest daughter, Zoe, when she heard that the bushfire had destroyed her home at Kinglake West.

Zoe had been swimming in a dam that morning with two school friends, who died later in the blaze.

Bellamy’s other daughter, Mary Jane, now 28, had driven over to her father’s place to rescue him.

“She told him to get out. He didn’t want to go, he wanted to stay. She made him get out. There were trees falling down,” Bellamy says.

“At the intersection she went the right way – had she gone the other way she might have died. That really affected her, she had a bit of a breakdown. She couldn’t come down for quite a while, she couldn’t drive for quite a while. But she’s doing really good now.”

The only things that survived on Bellamy’s property were a reclining Buddha statue and the letter box.

Emotional toll on local police

In the weeks following the fires, survivors had a steady stream of funerals to attend and in the years since there have been more.

The gruelling task of attending suicide deaths has taken its toll on local police, says Jason Caine, the father of a local leading senior constable who was on duty during the 2009 fires and received an Order of Australia medal for his role.

“[Cameron] was always a people person and now he’s got PTSD,” Caine says. “He was the town clown, he was a jovial person, but he’s not a jovial person now … he’s just languishing in a chair at home.”

Kinglake West CFA volunteers Peter Sharman and Jason Caine wash the trucks as part of the weekly routine during fire season.

At the Kinglake West Fire Brigade, captain Frank Allan is supervising volunteers washing firetrucks on a Sunday morning in January. Behind them, rays of sunlight stream on to the yellow uniforms hanging from hooks on the shed wall.

Allan was on one truck and his wife, Karen, was on the other on Black Saturday.

“We actually got caught out there and had to stay there because we couldn’t get back in for a couple of hours,” he says.

“She knew that we’d made a call that we were stuck. At one stage we were probably half a [kilometre] apart but our truck radios couldn’t talk to each other.”

He says the radio systems are now digital, but have not been tested in thick smoke.

Deb and Mark Morrow’s home was burnt out at Kinglake West and their daughter Bronnie and her young family lost their home in nearby Pheasant Creek.

Mark is a retired firefighter who used to work for Melbourne Water. A decade ago, he was out on the back of the firetruck for weeks on end.

Clockwise from top: Deb Morrow in the regrowth surrounding her home in Kinglake West; a burnt log and wire were all that remained of this power line.

“He’s a bit sensitive about [the fires] … he saw dead bodies, he’s seen a hell of a lot,” Deb says.

After rebuilding their house, the Morrows installed a bore, a buffer area at the back of the property, four fire-fighting pumps and solar batteries, and have a dam that is always full of water.

“We are really self-sufficient,” Deb says. “I’m petrified of fires. I never go away in summer. It’s changed my whole life. I never go on summer vacations. We are here. One of us is here at all times.”

It took four years to feel a sense of a new normal. “It’s like you had a second life,” she says.

The Morrows were keen bird breeders and lost their collection of 100 exotic birds.

They were initially reluctant to take up the hobby again, but then a friend asked them to adopt a rescued galah. Soon enough, the rebuilt aviaries were home to colourful species including eclectus and blue-winged parrots, quails, finches and rainbow lorikeets.

Deb Morrow says: “The fires couldn’t take my memories. My cup is always half full, never empty.”

theguardian,MPs and peers call for end to indefinite detention,['Owen Bowcott'],"Joint committee on human rights says people should be held for no longer than 28 days

Indefinite detention in immigration centres is traumatic and the practice should be stopped, with people ideally held for no longer than 28 days, a parliamentary committee has recommended.

In a highly critical report, the joint committee on human rights (JCHR), made up of MPs and peers, described the UK’s immigration system as “slow, unfair and expensive to run”, and said detention should be authorised only by decision-makers independent of the Home Office.

About 27,000 people a year are detained in Britain for immigration purposes, usually without being given a date for release or deportation. A small proportion are held for more than a year.

“Indefinite detention causes distress and anxiety. [It] can trigger mental illness and exacerbate mental health conditions,” the report warned.

“The lack of a time limit … reduces incentive for the Home Office to progress cases promptly, which would reduce both the impact on detainees and detention costs.” The detention system costs £108m a year to run.

The report, produced in the aftermath of the Windrush scandal, said many detainees are wrongly being held in “prison-like” conditions and are entitled to compensation when mistakes are admitted.

The UK is the only European country that does not impose time limits. Harriet Harman, the chairwoman of the JCHR, said: “If a person is suspected of a crime, they cannot be detained by the government; they can be detained only by the police, who are independent of government.

“If the police want to continue to detain a person beyond 36 hours, they have to bring that person before a court, which is … totally independent of government.

“But if the Home Office suspects a person of being in breach of our immigration laws, there is a complete absence of independence in the decision making. A civil servant – nameless, faceless and behind closed doors – just ticks a box to detain them. The first that person will know about it is when someone bangs on their door in the early hours of the morning to bundle them into an immigration enforcement van and take them to a detention centre.

“With no independence in the decision making, and with no scrutiny or accountability, mistakes are inevitable … We do know that £21m was paid out by the Home Office in just five years to compensate for wrongful detention, and terrible mistakes are certainly what happened in the Windrush cases.”

The committee made five recommendations:

The decision to detain should not be made by the Home Office but by officials or judges working for an independent body.

A 28-day time limit to end the “trauma” of indefinite detention should be introduced. In “exceptional circumstances”, when detainees frustrate removal attempts, the Home Office should be able to apply to a judge for a further period of detention of no more than an additional 28 days.

Detainees should have better access to legal aid and advice to challenge detention. Foreign nationals liable to deportation at the end of prison sentences should not have to wait until they are in immigration detention to begin a challenge.

Vulnerable individuals in immigration detention should be identified earlier and treated appropriately.

The Home Office should improve oversight and inspection of conditions in detention centres to “ensure that any ill-treatment or abuse is found out immediately”.



Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said: “Indefinite immigration detention is the foremost human rights scandal in the UK today. The JCHR has expertly laid bare the injustice and abuse inherent in our current system. A strict 28-day time is urgently needed along with early judicial oversight and safeguards against cat and mouse re-detentions. Parliament will have the opportunity to take this historic step when it considers the immigration bill and we urge MPs of all parties to take it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/07/mps-peers-committee-end-indefinite-detention-report-human-rights,2019-02-07 00:00:00
theguardian,A special place in hell? Donald Tusk didn’t go far enough | Martin Kettle,['Martin Kettle'],"Donald Tusk should be criticised not for his malice, but his moderation. The European council president triggered a tsunami of confected outrage from leavers today when he observed, with some justice, that there should be a special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit without a plan. But he should have said far more. He should have added that, within that special place, there should be an executive suite of sleepless torment for those politicians who promoted Brexit without ever giving a stuff about Ireland.

Dear Theresa May, your Brexit plan is doomed. Here’s a deal that will work | Gina Miller Read more

Once again, Brexit is all coming down to Ireland. This was always going to happen, and rightly so. Time after time in our history, Ireland emerges as an awkward reality check that shames the fantasies of those who think the British are better and that Ireland can be ignored. So there is something both fateful and tragic about the fact Theresa May should have prepared for the final showdown by having to make a rare visit to Ireland.

It wasn’t meant to be this way. For the Brexiters, the leaving of Europe was never about Ireland at all. Brexit was about sovereignty, about greatness, or about not liking too many foreigners living here. It was about throwing off the yoke of Brussels and bringing back blue passports. Ireland barely got a look-in during the debates of 2016, save when John Major – yawn, yawn – and Tony Blair – hiss, boo – pointed out from lifetimes of experience that Brexit would threaten the Northern Ireland peace agreements.

Their warnings fell on stony ground, except, not irrelevantly, in Northern Ireland itself, where the majority voted to remain. This was a deeply embarrassing outcome for the Brexiters. Surely a place that wraps itself in the union jack so often would be full-hearted for a Brexit project that did exactly the same? When the Northern Ireland voters failed to oblige, the Brexiters did what fantasists do. They pretended that it hadn’t happened. In this, they were of course assisted by May’s decision, after the 2017 election, to make a pact with the Democratic Unionists, the only important Northern Ireland party to support leaving the EU.

Then came the backstop, designed to prevent a hard border, which is now incorporated into the withdrawal agreement. The political intimacy that has grown up in recent months between the Tory Brexiters and the DUP might lead the unwary to assume they look at the issues in the same way. But they do not, as the backstop repeatedly shows. It is an opportunists’ alliance, nothing more, nothing less. It cannot and will not hold.

The DUP hates the backstop because nationalists support it. They pretend that it could cause regulatory divergence between Britain and Northern Ireland – though they support divergence on issues such as criminal law and some tax issues. They see Dublin’s hand at work everywhere. But the DUP did not get where it is today by compromising with Irish nationalism. So, if Sinn Féin and the SDLP in the north are in favour of the backstop, and if Dublin is in favour too, then the DUP is hardwired to be against it. Their position is tribal.

The Tory party’s Brexiters are not tribal so much as fanatical. They are a mix of English nationalists and trade autonomists. They hate the backstop because it gets in the way of their deregulatory obsession – conveniently ignoring that the EU is in fact a free trade market. For the Brexiters, the Irishness of the backstop is incidental. For the DUP it is everything. While the DUP is trying to preserve Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, the Brexiters dream of global conquest.

That is why May’s visit to Northern Ireland is part of a forlorn effort to unite her party behind a tweaked withdrawal agreement that still contains a backstop. In Belfast this week she gave the game away. “I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future,” were her words. Today it became clear that May is not relying on a technological fix on the border, not least because of nationalist sensitivities. Northern Ireland businesses liked what they heard. The Tory Brexiters did not. There were fresh calls to bin the backstop, and renewed threats to vote down any deal of which it forms part. David Davis, inevitably, said he’d be able to get things sorted quickly if he was in charge.

It would be foolish to assume May has no chance of marshalling a narrow Commons majority behind some version of her EU deal next week. But the odds remain long because she wants to do the right thing, more or less, in Ireland. This has always divided the Tory party down the middle, since the era of Robert Peel. And as Peel found out, it was difficult for a great Tory leader, never mind a limited one.

In 1846, Peel came to the House of Commons to propose the repeal of the corn law tariffs on imported grain. Much of his Tory party, which represented landed interests in the areas where British grain was grown, would have nothing to do with his plan. Peel was a pragmatist: he only became a repealer because events demanded it. Those events were the Irish potato blight and famine. The decision to repeal broke the Tory party for a generation.

Peel could, he admitted to MPs, have concealed the seriousness of the situation in Ireland by “rousing the British lion or adhering to the true blue colour”. But the suffering of four million people in Ireland was too serious, and would only increase. Peel read out a series of shocking eyewitness accounts. “It is absolutely necessary,” said Peel, “before you come to a final decision on this question, that you should understand this Irish case. You must do so.”

It was a speech his critics could have dismissed, if the phrase had been in currency, as “project fear”. It was, in fact, project national interest. Some time next week, May is going to face a similar challenge. Britain in 2019 is not Britain in 1846. The issues faced by Peel and May are very different. But Conservative MPs still face the same question – the need to understand the Irish case.

theguardian,True aims of the Syrian Democratic Forces | Letters,[],"Their military aim is the defeat of Islamic State and their political goal is secular democracy and autonomy in northern Syria, not the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, writes Rosa Gilbert of the Kurdistan Solidarity Campaign

The Syrian Democratic Forces, the multi-ethnic secular forces in northern Syria primarily made up of the Kurdish YPG as well as other local Assyrian, Arab and Turkmen groups, have never sought the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad as your article suggests (British hostage Cantlie, seized by Isis in 2012, is alive, says Home Office, 6 February). Their military aim is the defeat of Islamic State and their political goal is secular democracy and autonomy in northern Syria as seen by the multi-ethnic, feminist, democratic socialist, commune-based society they have been constructing in the areas they have liberated from Isis. There have been no major battles with regime forces and in fact they have worked with the Syrian Arab Army in the Kurdish Aleppo district of Sheikh Maqsood, which was liberated from al-Nusra jihadists in 2016.

theguardian,Salif Keita: ‘Democracy is not a good thing for Africa’,['Kim Willsher'],"The ‘golden voice of Africa’ has just released his final album. And though he is visibly tired, he is still in love with his guitar

Salif Keita, Mali’s most famous musical son, is going home. “I’m returning to the land,” he says. “I was a farmer’s son. I am a farmer’s son. Now, I will go back to the country and cultivate.” Cultivate what? I ask, not for the first time. Keita does not answer, not for the first time. He closes his eyes and falls silent. When he does speak, it is bursts of a few words and short, stilted answers.

I am in a modest hotel suite in the north of Paris with one of the greatest musical talents the African continent has ever produced. Keita, known as the “golden voice of Africa”, has enjoyed a career spanning more than half a century. Now nearly 70 years old, he is known not just for his extraordinarily powerful and passionate voice, but for the genetic condition he has called albinism that has made him, he says, “white of skin and black of blood”. He has sung for Nelson Mandela, and in aid of Ethiopia. He continues to sing to highlight the desperate plight of those with albinism across Africa, giving his time and talent to raise funds.

Keita is eating breakfast, a plate of fried chicken and onions, chunks of crispy baguette and milky tea. His answers are brief and so softly-spoken it’s a struggle to catch the occasional word in between the food and the clatter of cutlery. More than once, he stops eating, looks pained, and rubs both his hands vigorously over his face.

He is in Paris to promote his 14th album Un Autre Blanc (Another White), the title a reference to his struggles as a singer-songwriter with albinism. Keita says it is definitely his last. “I will do some concerts and perhaps some tours. Nothing major and not another album.” He shakes his head. “Too much work. I am going to rest.”

Going “back to the country” means returning to the village of Djoliba, 23 miles south of the Malian capital Bamako, which takes its name from the local Mandingue language for the river Niger on whose banks it sits. Keita grew up here, during the last years of French colonial rule – Mali became independent in 1960 – as one of 12 children in a family directly descended from the warrior king Sundiata Keita, the 13th-century founder of the Mali empire. They were aristocratic, but dirt poor.

The musician has said his father was shocked but not entirely surprised when he was born with albinism, a condition caused by the absence of melanin pigmentation in the skin. There had been others with the condition on his mother’s side of the family. “It is a problem in places where cousins marry, a problem of culture,” he explains.

As a child, Keita’s family kept him out of the fields, where working under the fierce sun was out of the question, but they were unable to protect him once he started school. “There were 500 students and I was the only white. Of course, I realised I was different and they didn’t let me forget it. I was bullied. Physically. It was not easy. I learned quickly how to defend myself.”

He adds: “I was a good student. My dream was to be a teacher, but in those days you had to ask the government to find you a post. After I finished my studies, the doctor [at the training school] told me I couldn’t be a teacher because I would scare the children. They also said it was because of my eyes … but I had special glasses and could see perfectly well.

“I didn’t want to be a musician. I am from a family of nobles. In Mali, nobles don’t make music – that’s for the griots,” he continues, referring to West African troubadour storytellers. “But I had no choice. I could be a musician or I could be a delinquent, a criminal, a thief, a bandit.”

I am curious as to why these were the only options. “I am an albino. What else could I do? There was nothing else. My family didn’t want me to be a musician. They tried to stop me. So I left,” he says.

Keita went to Bamako, and began singing in cafes and restaurants. He taught himself to play guitar, first joining the Rail Band, entertaining guests in the hotel restaurant at the railway station, then the Ambassadors, who were based at a hotel with an international clientele.

“I decided to learn the guitar and do some music. It was just something to do while waiting to find another job. I didn’t think I would be a professional musician but in the end I never had another career. It was a surprise to be so successful.” Success also brought reconciliation with his family. “Later, when they saw that I was famous, they accepted it more.”

I had no choice. I could be a musician or I could be a delinquent, a criminal, a thief, a bandit Salif Keita

In the 1980s, Keita moved to Paris where he released his first album Soro, and in 1988 he was invited to join the anti-apartheid Nelson Mandela 70th birthday tribute at Wembley stadium, an event relayed to 67 countries with an audience of 600 million. London does not appear to have made a huge impression on the singer, then or since. “It’s always raining.”

As he travelled, he picked up different musical influences including Cuban salsa and European bands like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, taking “bits and pieces here and there” and creating the afro-pop sound he is credited with founding. “But I never wanted to go far from my traditions. There is a melody, a heart, to Malian music that’s almost oriental,” he says.

He becomes more animated when asked whether he will use his retirement to become more involved in politics. Mali, one of the world’s poorest nations, has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012 and sparked the overthrow of the president. French forces intervened to push them back the following year but Islamists have since regained a foothold in the north and centre, exploiting ethnic rivalries to recruit new members.

“It’s hard to be a good person when you are corrupt, and our politicians are always corrupt,” Keita says. “Mali is the most corrupt country in the world after Cameroon.

“Democracy is not a good thing for Africa. We were all happy to see democracy come to Africa, but it destroyed the human sensibility. To have a democracy, people have to understand democracy, and how can people understand when 85% of the people in the country cannot read or write? They need a benevolent dictator like China has; someone who loves his country and acts for his country.”

Close to his heart is an ongoing campaign to raise awareness of albinism and help sufferers. Across the continent, folklore and superstitions mean sufferers are shunned or worse, beaten, killed and dismembered for their body parts credited with magical powers.

Last November, Keita organised a benefit concert to raise awareness of the problem after a five-year-old girl with albinism, Ramata Diarra, was ritually killed and beheaded in the town of Fama, 80 miles west of Bamako. “Never again,” he said at the event. “I have the strong hope that people will understand that we are born in the same way and we have the same rights as everyone else.”

He now oversees two foundations – Salif Keita Mali and the Salif Keita Global Foundation, based in the US – to continue this campaign. As well as combating prejudice, it offers practical help for sufferers, distributing suncreams to lessen the risk of skin cancers, and spectacles.

“We have to speak out. People with albinism are killed because of old beliefs that say their limbs have powers. This kind of belief is not finished in Africa,” Keita says. “It is true that people who are different are badly treated all around the world. It is different for me now – people hardly notice I am an albino. If you are famous, you pass unnoticed. But this work is a duty, a duty to give something back. If I am popular, I must serve others and this is how I do it. What I am saying is that the colour of your skin is not a handicap … and it’s not very important either.”

It is the most he has said in one go in the last hour, but now our time is up. Keita has a busy schedule of interviews before he returns to Africa with his “wife”. I am about to ask when he nods to two black guitar cases propped against the wall.

theguardian,Last-minute legal moves save detainees from deportation flight to Jamaica,"['Diane Taylor', 'Amelia Gentleman', 'Katharine Viner', 'Ms Dynamite']","Last-minute legal interventions have led to a number of detainees being removed from a deportation flight to Jamaica, but the Home Office said 29 others were onboard the chartered plane.

More than 50 foreign national offenders who were being held in detention centres were reported to be due to be placed on the flight. But many of them were able to have their removal cancelled after their lawyers took action.

The Home Office initially indicated that many of those due to be deported were rapists and murderers. But officials provided a breakdown of crimes committed by the offenders on Wednesday that said one person on the flight had been convicted of murder and four of various sexual offences including rape.

Fourteen people on the flight – almost half of those being deported – were convicted of drugs offences. Six people had been convicted of violent crimes including grievous bodily harm and battery and three of firearms and weapon offences. One person’s conviction was for dangerous driving.

New Jamaica deportation flights attacked as 'insult to Windrush victims' Read more

The Home Office said the total combined sentences of the 29 people on the flight amounted to more than 150 years. Lawyers, human rights activists and others have expressed concern about the charter flight and the last-minute nature of the decisions to remove some people from it.

The former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw, who has conducted two independent reviews of immigration detention for the Home Office, said the inclusion of people who have lived in the UK since childhood on these flights was “very cruel”.

Shaw recommended in a report published last July that foreign national offenders who had been in the UK since childhood should not be removed.

Omar Khan, of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, expressed concern about the late cancellation of some detainees’ places on the flight: “These ad hoc reprieves are a reflection of the dysfunctional nature of the system.” He raised concerns about the government’s decision to go ahead with the deportation flight before the publication of the Windrush lessons learned review.

Some people were told they would not be flying hours before the plane was due to leave. Others were removed from the flight just before it took off and returned to detention centres.

Shaw said that while the legislation introduced in 2007 was clear that those who had served sentences of more than a year should be deported, there was some room for manoeuvre.

“The Home Office does have some discretion on this issue. It can place much higher value on family ties. It just needs to change its approach. It’s very cruel to remove people in this way,” he said.

Twane Morgan, who was discharged from the army with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2007 after serving two tours of Afghanistan, was reported to have been waiting on the flight in handcuffs before being removed.

Morgan was told he must leave the country after he stabbed and almost killed a man in Birmingham in 2010 and was subsequently sentenced to six years in prison.

Two witnesses to the death of the Jamaican immigration detainee Carlington Spencer in 2017 – Joseph Nembhard and Christopher Richards – were not deported following last-minute legal intervention from their lawyers and a witness summons from the senior Lincolnshire coroner stating they were required to attend a pre-inquest review hearing next month.

The Labour MP Lucy Powell said her constituent Owen Haisley was also taken off the list for deportation at the last minute after she raised his situation with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the immigration minister Caroline Nokes on Tuesday. Haisley, a youth worker and DJ who has been in the UK for 41 years, since he was four, was issued with a deportation order after serving a 12-month sentence for assault.

Haisley remains in detention and has not been told whether he will be released. “No one has explained anything to me. Last night my name was on a list to be deported and then it was off the list. I don’t know why,” he said by telephone from his cell. “I just hope the Home Office understand now that I have been here for 41 years and that my whole life is here, and I’m British.”

Charities in Kingston were planning to assist some of the deportees on arrival in Jamaica. Those on the flight were expected to be met by Jamaican police and processed at a police station near the airport. Anyone without relatives to stay with would be helped by the National Organisation for Deported Migrants (NODM) and other housing charities, said Oswald Dawkins, who runs the NODM.

A Home Office spokesman said: “The law requires that we seek to deport foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK. This ensures we keep the public safe.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/06/jamaican-detainees-last-minute-deportation-reprieve-home-office-flight,2019-02-06 00:00:00
theguardian,Record numbers from China and Hong Kong applying to study in UK,"['Richard Adams', 'Marthe De Ferrer']","Record numbers of students from China and Hong Kong are applying for places at British universities, overtaking the number of applicants from Wales, according to official figures.

Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) shows a spike in demand for undergraduate places from mainland China and a small rise in applications from the EU, despite fears over Brexit.

The figures taken from Ucas’s January deadline, when the bulk of undergraduate applications are made, show a 1% decline in UK applicants, but a 9% surge from international candidates meant the total number of applications went up for the first time in three years.

The number of applications from China and Hong Kong rose from more than 17,000 last year to 21,000 this year. In contrast, only 18,850 applications came from Wales, meaning that if those trends are sustained there will soon be more undergraduates from China studying at British universities than from Wales.

Last year there were also more than 100,000 postgraduate students from China and Hong Kong at British universities, out of nearly 350,000 full-time postgraduates.

Overall the numbers will come as a relief to the higher education sector, after widespread concern that the Brexit crisis would erode applications from within the EU and outside Europe.

British universities have redoubled their recruitment efforts overseas, while for European applicants it may be their last chance to access lower tuition fees and student loans before Britain exits the EU. International students from outside the EU generally pay much higher fees and are not eligible for loans from the UK government.

Clare Marchant, Ucas’s chief executive, said: “‘In this time of uncertainty, it’s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.”

Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of British universities, said despite the latest figures the UK risked falling behind rivals such as New Zealand.

'The sooner you go home the better': is this the UK's message to international students? Read more

“We are calling for a new graduate visa that will make the UK more attractive to international students, allowing a wider range of employers in all parts of the UK to benefit from access to talented graduates from around the world,” Jarvis said.

Application rates from within the UK also appear to have defied predictions of a fall-off driven by rising student debt. Despite a 2% fall in the number of 18-year-olds in the population, the proportion from that age group applying to university jumped to nearly 39% in England, while in Wales there was a rise to above 32%.

“The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study,” Marchant said.

Policymakers will be pleased to see a narrowing in the gap in applications from the least and most advantaged households, with 23% of young people living in areas of low educational attainment now applying for places.

The results came against a background of uncertainty over funding, with a review commissioned by Theresa May expected to recommend tuition fees be cut to £6,500-£7,000 from their current level of £9,250.

“To drive social mobility and strengthen the economy, the current post-18 education review should recommend policies to support access for anyone who has the potential to benefit from a university education,” said Jarvis.

Universities UK this week launched a national campaign asking the government to keep funding study abroad opportunities for British students if the UK cannot remain a member of the pan-European Erasmus student programme after Brexit.",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/07/record-numbers-china-hong-kong-applying-study-uk-universities,2019-02-07 00:00:00

theguardian,From Iraq to Yemen: the grubby business of counting the war dead,['Peter Beaumont'],"A Labour MP’s grotesque take on Yemen war casualties serves only to show the sordid and politicised nature of body counts

Counting the bodies in conflicts is a necessary, confusing and too often sordid business.

Body counts are necessary for obvious reasons. Numbers supply a moral reference point. They tell us about the scale of a conflict as well as if civilians were targeted and how. They provide evidence for different kinds of human rights advocacy in an international setting, and assist in setting policy for emergency assistance.

Where counting the bodies becomes sordid, however, is when the process becomes political and weaponised for a purpose; that is, when it is in hock to competing agendas.

Official UN statistics put the death toll in Yemen as of March 2018 at 6,592, with 10,470 people injured. International organisations say the number of deaths is somewhere between 56,000 and 80,000 deaths. Each side accuses the other of reducing or inflating numbers to suit their own agenda.

The problem – as the current conflict in Yemen is demonstrating, and the Iraq war showed before – is that counting the cost of war is a far from exact science. Not least when it comes to the often fraught reckoning of a figure that can include both direct casualties of violence and those who have died from conflict’s secondary effects, such as limited access to health care.

From Iraq to Darfur, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and now Yemen, accounting for mortality in conflict has become an evidential battlefield.

The issue was dramatised again this week by the clumsy and one-sided intervention of Graham Jones, the Labour chair of the Commons committees on arms export controls (CAEC), who unintentionally underlined the difficulty of estimating mortality in conflict – in this case, civilian deaths from Saudi-coalition airstrikes.

Accusing international NGOs of dishonesty in their reporting, Jones promptly demonstrated his own agenda by seeking to paint Iran, backer of the rebel Houthis, as the principal aggressor.

“It’s disgraceful how NGOs and loony leftwing organisations have refused to back the UN’s unanimous position,” said Jones, provoking fury from aid groups.

“We desperately need peace in Yemen, not fantasy answers made in safe European homes.”

And while Jones has complacently suggested that he feels far more comfortable with lower casualty tallies provided by “generals and the Ministry of Defence,” it is significant that, across the Atlantic, the Pentagon was sufficiently concerned about the issue to launch a major exercise aimed at understanding why its own accounting of civilian deaths is so much lower than that of respected watch groups.

But if Jones’ comments appear grotesquely one-sided – gifting the Saudi-led coalition apparent impunity for its role in the war’s human toll – they do, at least, underscore a wider problem in Yemen: the huge disparity in estimates of the number of victims of the war.

As of late last year, those estimates ranged from about 10,000 dead to almost six times that number. Few believe the lower estimate, while for it’s part Save the Children has claimed that 85,000 children under the age of five alone “may” have died from starvation during three years of conflict.

So who is getting it wrong?

The reality, as anyone who has studied the figures for malnutrition and mortality in Yemen, is that – like Iraq – the numbers offered for public consumption encompass a vast spread of estimates.

If Jones has a point, it is that historically some NGOs have undoubtedly been guilty of a process of misery inflation. This is because they have sometimes sought to dramatise crises with the aim of highlighting their own interventions.

The real problem is not simply bad faith, but the paucity of tools applied to estimate mortality, not least the lack of baselines for comparison that has in the past led to guesstimates described, in at least one case, as no better than “statistical anarchy”.

Lack of continuous and accurate census and health data in numerous recent conflicts has made it difficult to effectively assess real increases in mortality.

That has left both UN agencies and NGOs to rely on far more fallible systems, to draw on methodologies open to error, bias and manipulation. The use of randomised household surveys designed to establish the number of deaths in conflict due to secondary causes is a case in point.

Some issues are painfully obvious: locations that cannot be visited because of security concerns leave holes in the data or, as in Yemen, require institutions allied with one of the warring parties to fill in the gaps. This leaves room to inject deliberate distortion.

Political considerations governing organisations operating in the field – not least UN agencies – can lead to uncomfortable trade-offs, not least over access.

Perhaps most difficult of all is unintended sampling biases. This was a contentious issue in the Lancet’s estimate of deaths in excess of normal fatality rates in Iraq. The journal was accused of failing to account for “main-street bias” – relying too heavily on locations where, critics said, more violence took place. This was denied by the authors.

None of this is news to those who, having made it their business to study mortality estimates, have long warned of their vulnerability to misinterpretation and manipulation.

As long ago as 2005, Francesco Checchi and Les Roberts, who have studied the issue, warned of many of these problems in a paper for the Humanitarian Practice Network.

Damning Yemen report calls on UK to come clean over arms exports Read more

Writing about humanitarian emergencies, both natural and – like conflict – manmade, they warned: “Mortality data are extremely liable to misinterpretation and manipulation.”. They added that “many would argue that recent years have seen the increasing use of relief as a tool for applying international political pressure or improving the image of occupying powers among the local population”.

Ironically, perhaps, Jones’ intervention is an urgent and overdue reminder that body counts need to be professional and unbiased, and that all actors – NGOs, UN agencies and influential MPs – must be transparent not only about what is known about the death toll in conflicts, but also about the limitations of their knowledge.

The alternative, as Checchi and Roberts argue, is a grim prospect, whether the problem is underestimation or its flipside.

theguardian,Young woman dies in fourth ‘period hut’ tragedy this year in Nepal,['Rebecca Ratcliffe'],"A 21-year-old woman has been become the fourth person known to have died this year as a result of the illegal practice of chhaupadi, whereby menstruating women in Nepal are banished from their homes and forced to sleep in huts.

Parbati Bogati, from the western Doti district, is thought to have died from smoke inhalation while sleeping in a small, windowless hut. She was discovered by her mother-in-law on Thursday morning.

Just weeks earlier Amba Bohara, 35, and her two sons, Ramit, nine, and Suresh, 12, were found dead in a cowshed. Their deaths, in neighbouring Bajura district, prompted some people to demolish chhaupadi sheds in their village.

Both women are believed to have suffocated after lighting fires to stave off freezing temperatures. Campaigners fear January may have been the worst month for such deaths in recent years, despite government efforts to end the practice, which has been banned since 2005.

Last year, penalties including a 3,000-rupee (£20) fine and a three-month jail term were introduced for those convicted of imposing the custom. However, chhaupadi, linked to Hindu religion, is deeply embedded in some parts of Nepal.

The tradition dictates what a woman can eat, where she can sleep and with whom she can interact while she is menstruating.

“It has been followed from the very beginning, from their ancestors, so if they discontinue with that kind of ritual, they fear that the god will punish them,” said Dechen Lama, a lawyer at the Forum for Women, Law and Development.

In 2010, a government survey found that one in five women across the country followed the practice. In Nepal’s mid-western and far-western regions, half of women surveyed did so.

In the capital, Kathmandu, versions of the tradition are still practised, said Lama. “[Women] are not isolated to the same extent – there is no separate hut – but they are not allowed to enter the kitchen when they go through menstruation, and they are not to touch the idols of god.”

Ganga Chaudhary, a lawmaker who was involved in the drafting of the legislation, told Agence France-Presse that much more must be done to enforce the law and change social norms.

“We have realised that legal provisions [alone] are not enough to end such practices. We need to focus on awareness and educating women,” Chaudhary said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/06/young-woman-dies-fourth-period-hut-tragedy-this-year-nepal,2019-02-06 00:00:00

theguardian,'County lines' drug gangs tracking children via social media,['Annie Kelly'],"A failure to grasp how technology and social media is being used to coerce, control, blackmail and track the movements of children as young as 11 by “county lines” drug gangs has seen an epidemic of child criminal exploitation spiral out of control in the UK.

“For the past seven or eight years we have been warning the government, the authorities, teachers, anyone who would listen, that technology is the central organising feature of the county lines business model,” said Sheldon Thomas, a consultant on gang behaviour through his organisation Gangsline.

“Social media and smartphones made kids easy pickings for drug gangs and once they use this technology to track and control children it is very hard, often impossible, to extract them from this world,” he said.

Last week the National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed that the scale of the county lines trade, in which criminal networks use children to funnel drugs from cities to towns and rural areas, was far greater than previously thought. New figures from the NCA show the trade has grown into a £500m industry.

“This is a crime that is fuelled by the criminal exploitation of vulnerable young people, who are often being groomed and radicalised online,” said Rhiannon Sawyer, a manager at the Children’s Society. “Children don’t need direct contact to be recruited and brainwashed on YouTube, Snapchat or Instagram.”

The victim is made to feel that they are constantly under surveillance and their every move is being tracked

Drug gangs have long used music videos on YouTube to present gang life as aspirational but in recent years individual gang members across the country have also amassed huge followings on Instagram and Snapchat, becoming social media influencers to young people in their area.

“When an older gang member – who is often like a local celebrity in their area – is taking the time to like or comment on your photos on Snapchat or Instagram then this is a huge deal to kids,” said Thomas. “It’s not hard to make them feel special and singled out. It’s all very public.”

Snapchat is used heavily as a recruitment channel, with gangs posting clips of children in trap houses with new trainers, piles of money and weapons.

“We’ve seen Snapchat posts with very young children posing with £30,000 in cash,” said Sawyer. “Gangs have always glamorised their lifestyles to suck in new recruits, but the growth of platforms like Instagram and Snapchat has moved this to another level.”

Once children are recruited, social media is often used to coerce and blackmail them, and track their movements.

Sawyer said she regularly works with young people who have been filmed by gangs being sexually abused, beaten and humiliated.

“Often, gangs make boys touch each other or undress, or young people are filmed having drugs inserted in their rectal passages or vaginas … and then they threaten to put these posts online if the young people don’t do what they say,” she said.

'County lines': huge scale of £500m drug industry revealed Read more

Sawyer added: “Sometimes they deliberately put the videos online and then after a month you’ll see the same child on Snapchat in a trap house [on] the other side of the country, trying to rebuild their dignity by showing that they are climbing up the gang hierarchy. We recently saw this scenario with a 12-year-old boy.”

Smartphones are also being used as tracking devices through apps like Find My Friends to monitor the movements of children transporting and selling drugs across the country. This practice, known as “remote mothering”, sometimes involves young people being forced to live-stream their movements 24 hours a day on WhatsApp or FaceTime.

“We’ve seen this regularly with domestic violence and honour-based crimes where the victim is made to feel that they are constantly under surveillance and their every move is being tracked, and this is happening with county lines,” said Sawyer.

“This is extremely traumatic and isolating. Young people who want to exit [gangs] don’t feel they’re able to seek help because the gangs will know where they are. We had one teenage boy who came in to one of our services and wouldn’t sit down. He just walked around and around the room because he was so paranoid that if he stopped moving they would find out where he was.”

Gang members send children pictures of their mother’s front door when they are on an operation and threaten to firebomb the house if they stop working for them. Young people are told their phone must be switched on and charged at all times and they must answer it within two rings, or they are threatened with violent repercussions.

“They have complete control of children through their phones,” said Sawyer. “There is nowhere for them to hide.”

Failing to tackle the use of mobile phones and social media by drug gangs to coerce and control young people has contributed to the huge growth in county lines drug operations, said Thomas.

“In many ways it’s too late to get a grip on this,” he said. “We were warning the government and the police about this almost a decade ago but nobody took any action, and now it’s got to the point where the state is trying to play catch-up with a situation that has moved far beyond their control.”

One solution, he said, would be to invest more in mediation and peer-to-peer mentoring schemes where young people can meet others who have gone through similar experiences.

The Children’s Society says official guidance and protocols around how social media is used to exploit and coerce children into criminal activities must be integrated into statutory services designed to tackle county lines operations.

“This is often an invisible form of coercion and exploitation that is happening without any adults being able or willing to intervene,” said Sawyer. “For these young people there is no difference between the online and offline worlds and we have to tackle this because we are facing a national crisis and this problem is only going to get worse.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/05/county-lines-drug-gangs-blackmailing-tracking-children-social-media,2019-02-05 00:00:00
theguardian,'Surprising' choice: police chief Sara Thornton tipped to be anti-slavery tsar,['Karen Mcveigh'],"MPs have expressed surprise over the appointment of one of Britain’s most senior police officers as Theresa May’s anti-slavery commissioner, eight months after the previous postholder resigned citing government interference.

Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, will take up the post later this year, the Sunday Times reported, although the Home Office did not confirm the appointment. A candidate would be “announced shortly” it said.

Thornton, a former chief constable for Thames Valley police, is seen as a controversial appointment. She was forced to apologise for the force’s failings in a child sex slavery scandal in Oxford in 2013, when hundreds of girls who were later found to have been groomed and sexually abused were not initially believed by Thames Valley officers.

Frank Field, MP, one of three politicians who reviewed the Modern Slavery Act and expressed concern over the independence of the commissioner’s post, said the appointment was “so surprising” that he would be seeking to instigate parliamentary scrutiny of the role, post-appointment.

Field, Lady Butler-Sloss and Maria Miller, MP, who published an interim review in December, urged the government to give up its search for a new anti-slavery chief and address concerns about the independence of the role before re-advertising. They had recommended the appointment should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, at pre-appointment hearings, but that had not happened, Field said.

“It is so surprising, this appointment, that I will be seeking agreement of Yvette Cooper that it carries out such scrutiny,” Field said.

Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, is undertaking a review of policy related to modern slavery. The Home Office is currently reviewing the Modern Slavery Act.

Field voiced concern that the appointment was once again a police officer, which emphasised the enforcement nature of the role.

Campaigners for slavery victims echoed his fears that the Thornton had a law enforcement background.

Bharti Patel, the chief executive officer of Ecpat, Every Child Protected Against Trafficking, said: “We are concerned we have another police officer. We have concerns that the position needs to be victim focused and does not just have a law enforcement aspect. We need a clear and adequate support system for children.

“In his review of the Modern Slavery Act, Frank Field was very keen that the position should be strong and robust, given that the current system has failed. This appointment is absolutely vital for us … We hope that Sara will push for a legal system of guardianship for vulnerable children.”

Hyland, appointed as the inaugural independent anti-slavery commissioner in 2014, as part of Britain’s Modern Slavery Act, resigned in May last year, citing a lack of independence in the role.

Aidan McQuade, slavery expert and former director of Anti-Slavery International, said: “Given the background of the candidate, I would have said it looks like a controversial appointment, but sometimes people who have made mistakes in the past can use their experience to become transformative in the future. On that basis, I would wish her the very best of luck.”

McQuade has made no secret of his unsuccessful application for the post of commissioner. In an opinion piece in January, entitled “A poisoned chalice? Challenges for the UK’s next anti-slavery commissioner”, published by Thomson Reuters, McQuade said the new commissioner would be forced to grapple with government policies that have detrimental effects on those affected by slavery in the UK. These included the “ferocious hostile environment” policy that gave rise to the Windrush scandal and the 2016 immigration act, which created the criminal offence of “illegal working”, an “additional direct threat” to the protection of slavery victims, he said.

The Home Office has advertised twice for the role – a three-year contract with a salary of up to £140,000.

Kate Roberts, head of office at Human Trafficking Foundation, said: “If the appointment is confirmed, we would hope that anyone in post would learn from their own past experiences of the need to support vulnerable people. The person in post should have the independence to step back from other agendas such as immigration control.

“We would like to see this move away from a criminal justice perspective into one of prevention, to look at what makes people vulnerable to traffickers and to look at hostile environment.”

Field’s interim report identified a catalogue of constraints on the Commissioners independence and concluded: “We are concerned by the statements of several stakeholders that the Commissioner was not free to scrutinise and criticise government policy and performance in addressing modern slavery.”

Hyland said that the Home Office should not be in charge of decisions relating to slavery victims.

“Home Office staff do not have the skills or the experience to make decisions about victims of serious and organised crime, which is what modern slavery is,” he said.

In the face of mounting criticism of its treatment of modern slavery victims, in October 2017, the Home Office pledged to radically improve support for victims of trafficking and slavery, and said it was putting the welfare of victims and potential victims at the heart of its anti-slavery agenda.

Britain is home to at least 136,000 modern slaves, according to the Global Slavery Index rights group Walk Free Foundation – a figure 10 times higher than a government estimate from 2013.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner (IASC) plays a crucial role in providing scrutiny of the government’s response to modern slavery.

theguardian,The key points from Trump's State of the Union address,"['Sabrina Siddiqui', 'Richard Wolffe']","The president pitched bipartisanship but struck polarising tone on immigration and socialism

The key points from Trump's State of the Union address

Donald Trump delivered his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, urging unity despite giving a speech that often reflected the country’s bitterly polarized political climate.

The president attempted to cast his agenda as bipartisan amid rising tensions over immigration following the longest government shutdown in US history last month.

Sign up for the US morning briefing

Trump’s remarks came as the White House and Democrats in Congress remain gridlocked over funding for the government, which is due to expire again on 15 February. A lack of a resolution would lead to the fourth shutdown of Trump’s presidency.

Here are key takeaways from his speech:

Trump pitches bipartisanship while pushing his own agenda

The president opened his address by extending an olive branch to Democrats.

“Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation,” Trump said.

“The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.”

This is not the first time the president has tempered his rhetoric; his previous two speeches before a joint session of Congress similarly saw Trump rein in the bombastic tone that has defined his political career.

But the broad appeals to both sides of the aisle have been fleeting, with little effort by Trump to follow through on bipartisan negotiations. Even as he spoke, the president was adamant that Congress approve funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border – a nonstarter with Democrats.

On immigration, a dark tone and scare tactics prevail

When the subject turned to immigration, the word “restraint” did not seem to feature in Trump’s dictionary.

Making his case for a border wall, the president pushed unsubstantiated claims linking immigrants to violence and crime.

“As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States,” Trump said.

“Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.”

The president has repeatedly turned to the notion that immigrants are primarily seeking entry to the US to commit violent crimes and expand the MS-13 gang, despite studies proving otherwise.

Trump has used such tactics to justify the need for a border wall and reaffirmed on Tuesday that absent money toward building one, a government funding bill would be unlikely to get his signature.

Trump celebrates women in moment rife with irony

One of the positive moments of the night came when Trump began extolling the progress made by women in the US workforce, prompting a standing ovation from the entire chamber.

At least 100 House female lawmakers, who had donned white in a nod to gender equality, stood and cheered as Trump exclaimed: “All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.”

The president pointed directly at the women in the audience, whose decision to wear “suffragette white” was in part a direct rebuke of his leadership. But Trump appeared to take the irony in jest, acknowledging the record number of women serving in Congress.

Play Video 2:10 Trump surprised by response from women in white during State of the Union address – video

Women did in fact win big in the 2018 midterms; a historic 126 women were elected to the 116th Congress, stemming from a backlash to the Trump presidency and the outsize role played by women voters at the ballot box.

Indeed, the reverie on Tuesday was short-lived as Trump later called on Congress to pass a bill that would prohibit late-term abortion. The same women who had moments before basked in the gains mentioned by the president looked on in silence.

Trump’s foreign policy doctrine: no more ‘endless wars’

The president defended his controversial decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and accelerate an end to the war in Afghanistan.

“Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years,” Trump said, while noting the US had spent more than $7tn in the region.

“As a candidate for president, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.”

Trump’s approach has put him at odds with US military and intelligence leaders, as well as Republicans in Congress.

Last week, the GOP-led Senate defied the president by advancing a measure that opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and Syria. Trump also publicly rebuked his own intelligence chiefs, claiming they were wrong in their assessment that the Islamic State militant group remained a threat.

Trump denounces socialism in 2020 election preview

It looked as though the president was simply speaking of the uprising against the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro. Claiming the Maduro regime’s “socialist policies” were to blame, Trump once again offered his blessing to Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó.

But the president swiftly shifted his attention back home, suggesting socialists were on the rise in America in a thinly veiled reference to the economic populism that has increasingly become the Democratic Party’s platform.

“Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” Trump said.

He added: “Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”

Several Democratic presidential candidates sat stoically in the audience, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kamala Harris of California. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is weighing a second bid for the Democratic nomination, looked visibly agitated by Trump’s comments.

It was perhaps a hint of what is to come in the 2020 election, with several Democratic candidates embracing progressive priorities that include the single-payer healthcare plan Medicare-for-All, debt-free college tuition, and universal paid family leave.

Republicans have sought to brand such ideas as “socialist”, despite polling showing the proposals as popular among the American public.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/05/the-five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-union-address,2019-02-05 00:00:00
theguardian,Trump's lip service to unity meets wall of resistance from the women in white,['David Smith'],"As the president railed against ‘partisan investigations’, the night’s momentum was with the diverse, hungry Democrats

It was the night that Donald Trump, preaching unity but practising divisiveness, found his white minority rule under siege from Nancy Pelosi’s women in white.

A year after wearing black to support the MeToo movement, the record number of Democratic women in the House of Representatives wore white at the state of the union address to honour suffragists who won the right to vote.

Trump was in for a shock. When he declared, “No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58% of the new jobs created in the last year,” the women in the House promptly stole his thunder.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand rose to her feet, turned around and, like an orchestra conductor, waved her arms at the great white heart of the Democratic side of the chamber. Close to 100 women stood up, clapping, cheering, laughing, punching their arms aloft, a collective force that Trump had tried and failed to stop in the midterm elections.

Forcing a smile, he said: “You weren’t supposed to do that!”

It was a moment of euphoria that summed up a shift in the balance of power this year: Republicans, a sea of suits and ties, a little less raucous than in 2018, the “Make America Great Again” hats gone; Democrats, more diverse by every measure, now defiant and hungry for 2020.

﻿Just as he did a year ago, Trump paid lip service to unity. He finessed the speech with citations beyond reproach: D-Day heroes and Holocaust survivors, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, a 10-year-old girl fighting brain cancer, a Swat officer who saved lives at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

“The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,” the president began. “It is the agenda of the American people... Tonight I ask you to choose greatness.”

But the meat in the political sandwich was red and bloody. In perhaps the most stunning remark of the night, and the one most likely to be replayed years hence, Trump said: “An economic miracle is taking place in the United States – and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.”

It was a direct assault on potential House investigations in general and Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation in particular. He went on: “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.”

Some Democrats shook their heads. One or two heckles could be heard. No one knows how to lose an audience better than Donald Trump. And the descent continued rapidly.

Trump devoted no fewer than 25 paragraphs of the speech to the so-called crisis at the US-Mexico border – yet zero to the global existential crisis of climate change. He warned of “ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers and human traffickers” and “the savage gang MS-13”. He claimed “large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States”, eliciting more Democratic head shakes and groans. He said he ordered 3,750 troops to the southern border, he said, “to prepare for the tremendous onslaught”.

He paraded a woman whose parents were killed by an illegal immigrant three weeks ago and an ICE special agent and reeled off crime statistics with grim relish.

Trump was also mendacious. He said the border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime and was one of the most dangerous cities in the country but “now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities”. Fact-checkers say El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities and crime was already falling when the fence went up.

Pelosi remained stony faced or glanced down at papers. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, a presidential candidate sitting between potential contenders Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, pursed her lips and gave slight shakes of the head. Congresswoman and socialist darling of the American left Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez refused to stand or clap, at one point studying a badge on her jacket.

Trump went on to defend his trade war against China and his new deal with Canada and Mexico. He prompted more Democratic derision by asserting that, had he not been elected, America would now be at war with North Korea, and by demanding fresh legislation against abortion.

And he declared: “Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.” Republicans cheered while Ocasio-Cortez grinned broadly and Senator Bernie Sanders stroked his chin, perhaps realizing that such a call-out, on such a platform and from such a president was likely the best boost socialism in America could hope for.

When it was over, after an epic 82 minutes, second only in length to Bill Clinton in 2000, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell patted Trump on the back and Brett Kavanaugh – one of only four supreme court justices in attendance – appeared to say “Good job”.

theguardian,The El Chapo trial's most shocking and bizarre moments,"[""Luke O'Neil""]","As the jury begins deliberations, we recap three months of amazing stories and allegations

Until his trial began, much of the public perception of accused Mexican drug lord El Chapo, real name Joaquín Guzmán, had come from rumours and legend. But over the past three months we have heard what the lead prosecutor, Andrea Goldbarg, called “a mountain of evidence” against the notorious leader of the Sinaloa cartel, including allegations of decades of murder, torture, bribery and corruption.

Is Emma Coronel the devoted wife of El Chapo, or is she being used as a prop? Read more

The stories from the trial have ranged from the horrifying to the downright bizarre; these are some of the most astonishing.

Live burial

Among the many violent exploits Guzmán is allegedly responsible for are three murders which a former bodyguard, Isaías Valdez Ríos, said he saw Guzmán commit. Valdez Ríos told the court of two occasions in which he witnessed Guzmán torture and murder members of a rival drug cartel. In one case in 2006 he is said to have instructed his men to dig a hole for a man they had been holding prisoner before shooting him. The victim was thrown in the ground still gasping for air and buried alive.

Eavesdropping

Numerous text messages between Guzmán and his wife and mistresses were read aloud in court. Cristián Rodríguez, a former tech expert for the cartel, testified that Guzmán had instructed him to install tracking spyware on the women’s phones. Rodríguez said Guzmán would often turn on the microphones of his lovers’ phones in order to “to see what they would say about him”. It was this technology that allowed prosecutors to read many of Guzmán’s text messages when they might not have otherwise been able to.

Parenting

Among the texts read in court were conversations Guzmán had with his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, mother to his two twin daughters.

“Our Kiki is fearless,” he texted when the girls were six months old. “I’m going to give her an AK-47 so she can hang with me.”

Bribery

As the trial began in November, Guzmán’s attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, alleged that Mexican officials, including former presidents Enrique Peña Nieto and Felipe Calderón, had received bribes to protect Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, a rival drug lord.

Later in January, Alex Cifuentes, a former associate of Guzmán’s put a price tag on his own alleged bribery, saying he had paid $100m to Peña Nieto. Both politicians have denied the allegations, calling them false and defamatory.

The court also heard of a number of other officials, including the former army general Gilberto Toledano, who was alleged to have received regular payments of $100,000 to look the other way along drug shipping routes.

Lucky escapes

On one occasion Guzmán texted his wife shortly after a narrow escape from a villa in Cabo San Lucas in 2012.

“I had to run out at 3 in the afternoon,” he wrote. “I’ve been scratched up, but fine. Thank God … I saw them pounding on the door nextdoor, but I was able to jump out.”

“Oh, love. That’s horrible,” she responded. “I’ll be watching the news to see what they say, love.”

Guzmán’s penchant for escape was also joked about in court when the lights briefly went out in the courtroom, leaving everyone in the pitch darkness. When the lights came back on, someone was heard to shout: “He’s gone!” Guzmán hadn’t moved, but according to Keegan Hamilton of Vice News: “Everybody laughed, except maybe the US Marshals.”

Moustache dye

After the raid Guzmán was said to have left all manner of incriminating evidence behind in the villa, including weapons, but in a text to his wife he shared with her a list of items he really needed her to go out and buy for him, including moustache dye and a new pair of Nikes.

His attorney argued that the evidence should not be admitted, saying there was no way of knowing if the shoes were actually his. “The jury has no way of knowing. If they don’t fit, what?” Eduardo Balarezo asked.

The line of argument led to a moment of levity at the trial with the witness, former FBI agent Jose Moreno, quipping: “What is this? The OJ trial?”

“You must acquit,” a heckler in the gallery shouted.

Animal lover

The jury was told of a lengthy list of homes, yachts and planes alleged to belong to Guzmán as well as a diamond-encrusted pistol. One detail in particular that stood out was a zoo Guzmán was said to have in Guadalajara, as Miguel Ángel Martínez, an associate, explained.

“It was a very nice ranch with a house, pool, tennis courts, and he built a zoo.”

The zoo was home to tigers, lions and deer, he said. Guzmán would ride around “in a little train”, he said.

In late January the Mexican actor Alejandro Edda, who plays Guzmán in the Netflix series Narcos: Mexico, arrived in court to observe the trial. The visit apparently pleased the real Guzmán, who reportedly grinned when he saw Edda in the courtroom. His attorney agreed he “seemed happy” to see Edda.

Edda scribbled notes during testimonies and borrowed a reporter’s binoculars at one point to get a closer look at the man whose life he inhabits onscreen.

“I think he’s guilty. There’s many, many horrendous things that he did,” Edda said. “The sad part is I know he’s not the only one. I know that not only the Sinaloan guys are the bad guys, there are many bad guys around us.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/el-chapo-trial-bizarre-shocking-moments,2019-02-04 00:00:00
theguardian,Why women 2020 candidates face 'likability' question even as they make history,['Sabrina Siddiqui'],"A record number of Democratic women intend to run for the White House at the next election, illuminating the gendered scrutiny they face

When Elizabeth Warren declared her intention to run for president in the 2020 US election, a debate swiftly followed over whether the Democratic Massachusetts senator could pass a “likability test”.

New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand was asked by a reporter if she was perhaps too “nice” to take on Donald Trump immediately after making her own announcement on her intention to run.

And California senator Kamala Harris faced scrutiny in rightwing media circles over her dating history after formally jumping into the presidential race.

As a record number of Democratic women seek America’s highest office – and look to limit Donald Trump’s presidency to a single term – familiar patterns have emerged in the narratives that surround them. But so, too, has a backlash to the old tropes, bolstered by the election of a record number of women in the 2018 midterm elections.

“I think in 2016, the idea that ‘likable’ was gendered wouldn’t have even come up. In 2019, people clearly recognized it and called it out,” said Jess McIntosh, who served as a communications aide to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the last election cycle.

“The thing that makes me the most hopeful about intractably sexist media coverage is that with multiple women candidates in the race it becomes really obvious what women have to deal with.”

Play Video 2:27 Three things you may not know about Elizabeth Warren – video profile

Women have already made history in what is shaping up to be a crowded and diverse field for Democrats, with the 2020 election poised to mark the first time more than one woman has fought for the party’s presidential nomination.

It’s a far cry from when Clinton stood alone in the 2008 primaries, and was infamously told by Barack Obama in a Democratic debate that she was “likable enough”. The coverage of Clinton in her first presidential bid drew widespread criticism for a relentless eye on everything from her personality and clothes to the tenor of her voice and what some media outlets characterized at the time as her “cackle”.

“Like her or not, one of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued – and accepted – role of sexism in American life, particularly in the media,” Katie Couric, then the anchor of the anchor of the CBS Evening News, reflected not long after Clinton was defeated by Barack Obama.

Eight years later, there was a palpable shift when Clinton launched her second campaign for the presidency. Much of the conversation around gender centered not on Clinton’s appearance or temperament, but rather the historic nature of her candidacy and the former secretary of state’s qualifications for the role of commander-in-chief.

What did not change, however, was the question of “likability” and ongoing commentary over Clinton’s trustworthiness – the latter propelled by the controversy over her emails and what some reporters have themselves acknowledged became a double standard in media coverage.

A report by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, released in the aftermath of the 2016 election, examined the role of gender in the campaign and found a double standard within perceptions of honesty and likability for women compared with men.

“Research on gender stereotypes reveals that voters may be less likely to expect honesty and ethical behavior from men than from women,” the report stated. “As a result, it is entirely possible that women candidates might be held to higher standards than men when it comes to honesty and ethics in their pasts and on the campaign trail.”

The backlash to the 2016 election was, in many ways, what paved the way for change

While the report found several factors contributed to those perceptions – namely the often misogynistic rhetoric that was a staple of Trump’s campaign rallies – its authors suggested the media played a role in advancing gender stereotypes by placing a constant emphasis on Clinton’s honesty and likability as opposed to that of her male counterparts.

But the backlash to the 2016 election was, in many ways, what paved the way for change.

The 2018 midterm elections ushered in what was dubbed as the “year of the woman”, as American voters sent a historic number of women to Congress.

Stephanie Cutter, a former aide to Barack Obama, said the momentum sparked by Trump’s election enabled female candidates to campaign more explicitly on their gender as an asset.

“Look at all those freshman candidates who fully embraced the fact that they were balancing work and family, that their kids were on the campaign trail, that they were dealing with breastfeeding and carpools and making their lives work while also running for office,” Cutter said.

“That was enormously appealing, particularly to all the women out there who are dealing with the same things every day.”

McIntosh said the #MeToo movement, which cast an unprecedented spotlight on sexual assault and harassment across a range of powerful industries, also brought with it a profound impact on how women are treated at every level, including by the media.

“You really can’t overstate what it means to have gotten some of these really badly behaving men out of positions of extreme power,” she said, while adding the emerging 2020 Democratic contenders: “If we froze the field right now, the top three candidates are women.”

“There are more women journalists, editors, anchors, and in charge of media organizations … Women have bigger platforms than ever.”

The candidates, for their part, have addressed gender to varying degrees but maintained a steadfast focus on the issues

Indeed, when a former mayor of San Francisco recently penned an open letter about dating Harris decades ago while implying he helped advance her career – the move was panned by several mainstream journalists.

“This is the kind of sexist power move that men have been pulling on women for too long and it’s embarrassing and needs to stop,” Kasie Hunt, an MSNBC news anchor, tweeted.

The “likability” factor nonetheless continues to loom over women candidates, with differing views as to whether the implication is inherently gendered.

Jennifer Lawless, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia, said the disproportionate attention paid to Warren’s “likability”, as opposed to that of Harris, might instead be a construct of name recognition.

The candidates, for their part, have addressed gender to varying degrees but maintained a steadfast focus on the issues.

Asked at an Iowa town hall last week if a male candidate was better suited to challenging Trump than a woman, Harris said it was a conversation that should simply not be entertained.

“In my entire career, I’ve heard people say, when I ran and ran as the first woman who would win … ‘People aren’t ready, it’s not your time, nobody like you has done that before,’” Harris responded.

foxnews,Russian officials reopen probe into mysterious deaths of nine skiers in 1959 Dyatlov Pass Incident,"['Kathleen Joyce', 'Kathleen Joyce Is A Breaking Trending News Producer For Foxnews.Com.']","Russian officials announced last week that they are reopening an investigation into the mysterious deaths of nine students who died in 1959 during a ski trip.

The deaths, known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident, have long sparked conspiracy theories surrounding what happened to the students.

Alexander Kurennoi, the official representative of Russia’s prosecutor general, made the announcement, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.

""All of [the deaths] are somehow connected with natural phenomena,"" he said.

RUSSIA MUST DEVELOP NEW MISSILE SYSTEMS IN RESPONSE TO US WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATY, MINISTER SAYS

""Relatives, the media and the public still ask prosecutors to determine the truth and don't hide their suspicions that something was hidden from them,” he continued.

The incident began when the students went on a skiing trip across the Ural Mountains in January 1959. They were led by Igor Dyatlov, a student at Ural Polytechnic Institute, and the group -- in all, seven men and two women -- started off on what they hoped would be a 16-day journey.

The group was supposed to send a telegram to Yuri Yudin, who was slated to join them on the trip but ended up not going, when they arrived at the village of Vizhai. However, the telegram was never sent. Officials launched a search party for the group Feb. 20, 1959 and eventually discovered a tent that seemed to be slashed from the inside.

The bodies of two partially clothed men were discovered near a tree. Three other bodies were discovered in the space between a tree and tent. Two months later, the four other bodies, also partially clothed, were discovered more than 245 feet from the tree. One of the victims was missing their tongue and a few others had broken bones and skulls.

Theories were launched on what happened to the group with some even saying they were abducted by aliens. However, Kurrenoi said that “crime is out of the question.”

""There is not a single proof, even an indirect one, to favor this (criminal) version. It was either an avalanche, a snow slab or a hurricane,” he said.

Andrei Kuryakov, a spokesman for the Sverdlovsk’s prosecutor’s office, said that investigators would use modern technology to probe.

China’s National Health Commission released a statement on Tuesday instructing “medical institutions across the country” to stop using a batch of human immunoglobulin distributed by Shanghai Xinxing Pharmaceutical after it received reports of positive HIV tests.

According to the website, the treatment is for thrombocytopenia (a platelet deficiency) and to control chemotherapy infections.

foxnews,Burmese military steps up operations against Christian minority,"['Hollie Mckay', 'Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq', 'Syria', 'Yemen', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Burma', 'Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts', 'War Crimes', 'Terrorism Around The World. Follow Her On Twitter']","The Burmese military has stepped up its operations against the country's mostly Christian minority and driven hundreds more from their homes and jobs, according to human rights groups, as the conflict between the government and the Karen ethnic group marks its 70th anniversary.

“Violations of the (2015) nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) and clashes have resumed. In January 2019 alone, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) were forced to destroy at least five Burma Army military vehicles attempting to attack deeper into Karen territory, and the Burma Army has begun shelling Karen civilian villages,” Ephraim Mattos, East Asia Operations Manager for The Nazarene Fund, told Fox News. “These clashes are happening in several places along the same road that caused major problems last year.”

Since Burma gained independence from the British in 1948, ethnic minorities – perhaps most significantly the Karen – have been locked in a simmering succession of war and alleged crimes against humanity in their quest to establish and maintain their independence. The Karen National Union (KNU), a political organization that represents the interests of the minority Karen and whose armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), agreed to what was hailed as a landmark agreement in 2015.

But that piece of paper has not put a stop the fighting.

""From January 18 until today, the Burma Army has been launching mortars from two different military outposts at civilian villages in an ongoing series of coordinated attacks,” said Mattos. While there have been no reports yet of civilian casualties, at least 200 Karen villagers – more than 80 percent of whom are Christian and facing the Buddhist-majority military – are said to be hiding in the jungle.

“However, dozens of village animals – their livelihood – have been killed or wounded. All of this was the week leading up to the January 31st 70th anniversary of the war. Mortars from both bases simultaneously have been targeting the same areas,” Mattos contended. “The mortar barrages last anywhere from 1 to 12 hours and have killed dozens of livestock in the villages.”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WALKING BACK OBAMA-ERA FOREIGN POLICY MISTAKES IN BURMA

Further documented violations allege that on the evening of Jan. 24, the Burma Army fired on Karen civilians walking in the hills around their own villages, screaming and taunting them as civilians ran for safety. No one was injured. Then on Jan. 31 – the 70th anniversary of the Karen Revolution – the Burma Army opened fire with mortars and machine-gun fire on KNLA defensive positions in the Paw Kay Kho area.

The uptick in skirmishes this year alone has prompted hundreds from the already impoverished minority to flee their homes. One exclusive video shot by the Nazarene Fund’s relief team on Jan. 25 in the Paw Kay Kho area, and viewed by Fox News, shows a female village leader carrying her belongings and fleeing apparent fighting.

“The Burma Army is shooting mortars and it not safe to live in the village. We are moving to the head of the river,” the leader informs the aid worker, detailing that her buffalo were hit with mortar rounds and that her entire family was afraid to stay in their homes. In another video, shot on the same day in the same area, children are seen fleeing apparent conflict.

BURMA DOUBLES DOWN ON CLAIMS TO JUSTIFY TREATMENT OF ROHINGYA MINORITY

A third video taken on Jan. 26 in Paw Kay Kho – filmed by the KNLA defense fighters – shows them seemingly holding defensive positions in preparation for a potential Burma Army ground assault. They claim all the background shooting is “coming from the Burma Army who are firing into Karen areas in violation of the NCA.”

Greh Moo, a community activist with the Karen Organization of America, who travels back and forth between the region and the United States, pointed out most parts of the semi-autonomous state remain peaceful. But he said there is still deep mistrust between the two sides, and concerns tensions will escalate.

“In the north, relations are still tense as the Burma Army fails to follow the ceasefire agreement, especially in terms of their territorial breach, their construction of a road and upgrade in military bases,” he said. “Early last month there was another skirmish between the Karen and Burmese army in Brigade 5 after the Burmese army again intruded into Karen territory against the ceasefire agreement. This again resulted in over one thousand Karen civilians fleeing their villages.”

WITH WORLD'S ATTENTION ON ROHINGYA MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS IN BURMA ALSO FACE BRUTAL PERSECUTION

Moo also said that despite seven years of negotiations and a peace process, “the Burmese army has not removed or downgraded any of its bases in the Karen territories but reinforced them, so fighting between the two sides is always a possibility if further progress cannot be made.”

A representative for Burma – also known as Myanmar – UN Mission was unavailable for further comment on the matter. And the country’s Washington embassy did not respond to a request for comment.

But the Myanmar military – often referred to as the Tatmadaw – accused the KNU on Jan. 25 of being involved in “ambush attacks against Tatmadaw troops, attacks against rival ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), inhumane treatment and torture of villagers, expanding the KNU military-controlled areas, illegal tax collection, and recruitment of new soldiers.”

“Specifically, it accused the KNU of nine ambush attacks against Tatmadaw troops and two car bomb attacks in the Southern Command area. The KNU admitted to the anti-vehicle mine attacks saying they were the result of a failure to hold negotiations to avoid further military engagements,” explained Erin Murphy, founder, and principal of the Burma-focused Inle Advisory Group, who served as the Special Assistant to the Office of the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma under Obama. “The KNU leadership said they were abiding by the terms of the Nationwide Ceasefire Accord (NCA) but that further discussions were clearly necessary.”

In October 2016, the Obama administration lifted economic sanctions against Burma, citing the country’s “substantial advances to promote democracy.” But the country has since regressed.

Last April, Burma’s military started building a road connecting two bases in the Karen state, which was widely depicted as a violation of the NCA. The alleged offenses resulted in more than 3,000 villagers being displaced. “The road construction has temporarily stopped, but it could resume again at any time as the Burma Army has not removed their equipment and tools in the hope that one day they can resume it quickly,” Moo said.

But seven decades of battles and bloodshed has put the Karen Revolution at an ultimate crossroad and prompted the leadership to take a critical breath in working to chart the next course of action and direction.

""After 70 years and with no progress, some Karen leaders believe the best way is to engage with the government as much as possible despite a lack of success. But there are also some who believe that the current peace process will not deliver any benefit to the Karen as the government and the Army are using this to mainly get the international pressure off them and attract foreign investment to kick start the economy,” Moo added. “As a result, investing in the peace process has only made the Karen more vulnerable.”",https://www.foxnews.com/world/on-the-70th-anniversary-of-their-war-with-the-burma-army-landmark-peace-process-in-jeopardy-as-hundreds-of-karen-christians-flee-their-homes-under-fire,

Auj-e Taqaddas, 43, was at Bali’s international airport in July when she missed her flight because of an altercation with an immigration officer. She was asked to pay a fine of about $4,000 (about $22 a day) for overstaying her visa, which had expired in February, Reuters reported.

foxnews,Mexico governor tells migrants to stay away from his border city: ‘No more caravans!’,"['Griff Jenkins', 'Griff Jenkins Currently Serves As A Washington-Based Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc . He Joined The Network In As A Radio Producer.']","PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Mexico -- The Governor of Coahuila, the Mexican state where this border city is located, has one thing to say after overseeing the arrival of a caravan of nearly 2,000 migrants: “No Mas Caravanas,” or no more caravans. That was the headline in the local newspaper.

“In the case of the state government, we will not allow more migrants to travel to Coahuila,” Gov. Miguel Riquelme told reporters.

The governor explained it wasn’t up to him to stop this caravan when it crossed Mexico’s southern border nearly three weeks ago because that’s the federal government’s job. But this one is here now and he’s doing everything he can to deal with it in the most humanitarian way.

And that way involves the enormous security operation that has contained the migrants at the shelter.

A multi-agency force that includes federal, state and local law enforcement has partnered with Coahuila’s Mexican Army and military police to keep all the migrants housed while they process temporary asylum claims.

POLICE IN RIOT GEAR LINE UP AT BORDER TO GREET MIGRANT CARAVAN

Out of nearly 2,000, only 139 migrants have obtained their official cards that will allow them to leave the shelter and travel freely throughout Mexico.

Authorities are also investigating whether the migrants have a criminal past. If they do, they will be deported immediately. So far, no one has been deported as a result.

This aggressive containment is intended for the security of surrounding Coahuila communities – and preventing the threat of them crossing the border, officials say.

The Security Secretary for Coahuila, Jose Luis Pliego Corona, wants Americans to know that they are doing everything possible to identify and remove any criminal threat in this group.

And caravans like this are taking a toll on border cities like Piedras Negras.

foxnews,Venezuela military sets up blockade on bridge to stop aid from Colombia,['Lucia Suarez Sang'],"Two blue shipping containers, an orange fuel tanker, and a makeshift fence are barricading a Venezuelan bridge at a key border crossing with Colombia in an attempt to block humanitarian aid from entering the country.

The Venezuelan National Guard on Wednesday blocked the Tienditas international bridge which connects the two countries and has become the location for a planned relief effort backed by the opposition.

“It’s means of intimidation, but I don’t think it will accomplish anything,” said Alba Pereira of nonprofit Entre Dos Tierras. “It’s convenient for them to let the country continue enduring this absurd crisis.

EU POWERS RECOGNIZE GUAIDO AS VENEZUELAN LEADER, DEMAND FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted the Venezuelan military's actions and demanded the bridge be reopened to let the aid through.

""The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The U.S. & other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela’s military under Maduro's orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE. #EstamosUnidosVE,"" he tweeted.

President Nicolas Maduro has repeatedly denied his economically devastated country is facing a humanitarian crisis, despite multiple reports coming out of Venezuela of people suffering from lack of basic necessities including access to medicine.

Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who claims to have assumed presidential power as head of the opposition-led National Assembly, has worked to push aid in through Venezuela’s borders in an attempt to further pressure Maduro’s regime and restore democracy in the country.

Guaido, who has the backing of roughly 40 countries led by the United States, has said the humanitarian aid will begin flowing into the South American countries despite Maduro’s objections.

He has urged border troops to not stand in the way of humanitarian aid that is intended to help “your family, your sister, your mom, your wife – who surely need these supplies.”

“The main goal now is to look to break the military – and the humanitarian aid is basically the Trojan horse to try to do that,” Maryhen Jiménez Morales, an Oxford University specialist in Venezuelan politics, told The Guardian.

Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo on Wednesday condemned any attempts to block aid from entering.

Speaking in Washington, Trujillo said he also spoke about the Venezuelan crisis in a meeting with U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton.

foxnews,"Mayor of Mexico border city dubbed 'Tijuana Trump' blasts caravan migrants, calls them 'bums' and 'pot smokers'","['Elizabeth Llorente', 'Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum']","Several weeks ago a Mexican federal judge ordered Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum to stop being hostile to migrants on the caravan that started in Honduras.

The ruling bans Tijuana officials from “issuing statements contrary to the protection of and respect for migrant people.""

Gastelum, a 65-year-old attorney, is not listening.

Called “Tijuana Trump,” Gastelum repeatedly has expressed his objections to the caravan and called for its organizers to be identified and prosecuted for taking advantage of desperate people and putting their lives at risk.

What most rankles immigration advocacy groups are his characterizations of caravan migrants -- thousands of whom have arrived in Tijuana, overwhelming its shelters and other resources – as invaders and criminals.

In local interviews, Gastelum, who occasionally has worn a “Make Tijuana Great Again” hat, said the caravan included “pot smokers, bums and bad people.”

“Tijuana is a city of migrants but we don’t want them [arriving] in this way. It was different with the Haitians, they had [immigration] papers, [their arrival] was orderly, it wasn’t a horde, excuse the expression . . .” he said, according to the Mexico News Daily. “These people arrive in an aggressive, rude way, chanting, challenging the authorities, doing what we’re not accustomed to doing in Tijuana . . . I don’t dare to say that it is all the migrants but there are some who are bums, pot smokers, they’re attacking families in [the beachside borough] Playas de Tijuana, what is that?”

Recently, a human rights coalition called on Gastelum to apologize for his attacks on the migrants. Gastelum essentially responded that they should not hold their breath.

“No, no, I’m not going to apologize,” he said, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune “Better that those who are against Tijuana apologize to us.”

“Tijuana is a migrant town,” he told the newspaper. “We’re barely 129 years old. My mom was a migrant. My grandparents were migrants. So, we are not afraid of migration. What we do not want is bad behavior.”

Gastelum’s in-your-face style was unpopular among many residents when he won the mayoral election in 2016 with just a third of Tijuana’s 1.29 million voters casting ballots.

POLICE IN RIOT GEAR LINE UP AT BORDER TO GREET MIGRANT CARAVAN AS US VOWS: 'WE STAND READY'

His approval ratings had been extremely low – only four percent -- the San Diego Union-Tribune reported, almost since he began his term.

But then the caravan of thousands from Honduras – and thousands more joining them along the way in El Salvador and Guatemala – headed toward Mexico, and many toward Tijuana, specifically, and suddenly many frustrated residents of the border city found Gastelum’s unvarnished and provocative style appealing.

Now, Gastelum is the front-runner in the mayoral election.

Tijuana is a migrant town. We’re barely 129 years old. My mom was a migrant. My grandparents were migrants. So, we are not afraid of migration. What we do not want is bad behavior. — Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum

Victor Alejandro Espinosa, a political analyst at Tijuana’s Colegio de la Frontera Norte, likened Gastelum’s focus on the caravan and its popularity with voters to Trump’s speeches about the border and its appeal to his base.

“It is a shame, but this could help explain the positive trajectory of support for the mayor among this segment of the Tijuana population,” he said.

Gastelum’s critics say he is exploiting the transgressions and crimes of a small group – less than 300 out of some 6,000 who have ended up in Tijuana -- to smear the entire caravan of migrants who are fleeing violence and poverty.

They say that most of the crimes that Gastelum frequently speaks about are drug possession and being drunk in public.

Enrique Morones, the president of San Diego-based Border Angels, a human rights group, said that Gastelum’s rhetoric encourages violence.

“How dare he call the migrants criminals, bringing diseases. He is promoting violence,” Morones said to the newspaper. “Hate words lead to hate actions.”

Gastelum takes aim at Mexico’s national officials for being, as he sees it, too tolerant of the caravan at Tijuana’s expense.

“I’m not going to compromise Tijuana’s economic resources to fulfill a wish of the federal government to try to show themselves as very humanitarian,” he said.

“Why don’t they escort them to Ciudad Juarez or Nogales or Agua Prieta? No, instead they escort them here?” he asked.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/mayor-of-mexico-border-city-dubbed-tijuana-trump-blasts-caravan-migrants-calls-them-bums-and-pot-smokers,

Christensen, a 46-year-old builder, was leading a local Bible reading when he was arrested. He is the first member of the Jehovah's Witness to be sentenced for extremism, Tanya Lokshina, the Moscow-based associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, told The Washington Post.

“Six years in jail for peacefully practicing your own religion is something that comes right out of the history book on Soviet dissent,” Lokshina said. “It sends a very strong signal to all those who are ready to stand up that there will be no mercy.”

Yaroslay Sivulsky, a representative of the European Association of Jehova's Witnesses, said Christensen will appeal the decision.

JURY: JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES MUST PAY $35M TO ABUSE SURVIVOR

“We deeply regret the conviction of Dennis Christensen,” Sivulsky said in a statement. “An innocent man who did not commit any real crime was convicted. It is sad that reading the Bible, preaching, and living a moral way of life is again a criminal offense in Russia.”

The religious group got a glimmer of hope in December when President Vladimir Putin publicly pledged to look into the reported persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses, calling extremism charges against the religion’s adherents “nonsense.”

But Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked about the case after the verdict, was unable to say if Putin had looked into the matter and had no comment on the ruling Wednesday.

Amnesty International has said that it considers Christensen and other Jehovah’s Witnesses on trial as prisoners of conscience.

Christensen’s lawyer Anton Bogdanov said that he will likely file an appeal within 10 days after discussing the matter with his client.

“The man was sentenced to six years behind bars, because he, along with others of the same religious beliefs, read the Bible and spread their religious views,” Bogdanov said.

Fourteen members of the ""Marranella"" clan were arrested and another seven are being investigated for the brazen theft and brutal attacks on rival gangs on Spain's southern Costa del Sol.

“With operation Maverick II we have disbanded one of the most important and violent criminal organizations dedicated to the international drug trade and based out of the Costa del Sol,” a Guardia Civil spokesperson said in a statement.

Authorities say members of Marranella obtained drugs by any means possible, including stealing them from other gangs.

""To carry out these thefts, members of this organization used extreme violence, not hesitating to use firearms to kidnap other area drug traffickers,"" the statement said.

Authorities ultimately seized about a half ton of hashish, a potent form of marijuana. They allege the group also bought the drug in Spain with help from a group of British citizens based in the southern province of Cadiz.

Once the Marranellas had the drugs in their possession, it was then ""transported to Rome by road, hidden inside rented motorhomes, with the trip carried out usually by a man and a woman hired by the organization, to appear as if they were a couple on vacation and not raise suspicions during any police controls.""

Police also located a hidden trapdoor in a farm in el Zabal de la Linea de la Concepcion, in Cadiz, where a hidden basement was used to stash up to a ton of drugs to be exported to Italy.

Based in Naples, the Camorra is one of Italy's three main organized crime groups, along with Sicily's Cosa Nostra and the 'Ndrangheta, which operated in the Calabria region. The Camorra crime syndicate is one of the oldest criminal organizations in Italy and dates back to the 17th century.

The attack on the northwest Nigerian town of Rann took place Monday and marked one of the most lethal in the group’s at least 10-year history, targeting those who had already been displaced by the ongoing conflict in what Amnesty indicated “may amount to possible war crimes.”

“Those responsible must be brought to justice,” Osai Ojigho, the Nigeria director for the human rights body stated.

The attack came two weeks after Boko Haram, a jihadist group that at one point aligned with ISIS, seized control of Rann and ran out Nigerian soldiers stationed there.

Ojigho said that witnesses told Amnesty investigators that soldiers abandoned their posts the day before the deadly attack, “demonstrating the authorities’ utter failure to protect civilians.”

Special Operations Chief Edward ""Eddie"" Gallagher will no longer face trial for allegedly performing a re-enlistment ceremony next to the corpse of the teenage militant or for operating a drone over it, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

""Chief Gallagher and the defense team are pleased the judge dismissed two charges as defective,"" Phil Stackhouse, one of Gallagher's attorneys, told Fox News in a statement. ""When charges are levied in a way that one can not be reasonably on notice that an act was criminal it’s indicative of overcharging and it appears that's what was happening here.""

Gallagher’s brother, Sean Gallagher, in an interview with Fox News in late November, accused the investigators of trying to “take down” an “elite warrior” so they could advance their own careers.

Despite the legal win, Gallagher is still facing the two more serious charges -- premeditated murder and aggravated assault.

He fought in Iraq and Afghanistan several times. But it was during Gallagher’s last combat deployment, in 2017, that prosecutors claim he lost his way and “decided to act like the monster the terrorists accuse us of being.”

Investigators allege that while the teen terrorist was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in the neck and side with a knife, killing the fighter. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter’s body, holding the militant's head in one hand and his blade in the other – and sent one of the images to a fellow SEAL with the caption “I got him with my hunting knife.”

foxnews,"As ISIS crumbles, Syrian Kurds worry about US troop withdrawal",['Benjamin Hall'],"AMUDA, Syria -- Pummeled by modern U.S. weaponry, ISIS has been reduced to a single town – Baghoz. Now the cruel caliphate is surrounded by members of the Syrian defense force – predominantly Kurds – who say there are just days remaining. Brave, but light on equipment, they rely heavily on the U.S.

Fox News was granted rare access to the frontlines – to witness the final stand.

It’s a long and hard road to the far east of the country – through territory still being attacked by ISIS sleeper cells. After three days on the road, first traveling west from Iraq then south through Syria, we finally reached a SDF base in the Omar oil fields in what was once an ISIS heartland.

U.S. forces are everywhere here. You catch glimpses of them moving around, on the frontlines and in forward bases. U.S. mortar teams, intelligence, artillery and airstrikes are the reason the territorial caliphate was destroyed so quickly.

In one U.S. base, Fox News saw hundreds of troops and dozens of U.S. armored vehicles – a reminder of the scale of U.S involvement. There are said to be 2,000 U.S. troops here, but some believe the actual figure is higher.

The following day, in an SDF Humvee, we slowly pushed forward to the battlefield, bogged down by rain and mud.

KURDISH FORCES WORRY ABOUT US TROOP WITHDRAWAL FROM SYRIA

ISIS had years to dig into these towns, crisscrossing them with tunnels and littering them with IEDs. That has left the land obliterated. For miles, there is nothing but dead bodies and rubble.

ISIS now holds just over one-square mile of land, with about 1,500 to 2,000 fighters. The defiant ones who remain are mostly foreign fighters unable to blend back into the local population, and they’re making their final stand.

At their peak, ISIS controlled about 40,000 square miles, roughly an area the size of Kentucky. They had 65,000 fighters and ruled over 8 million people. Today, all of that is gone.

When President Trump took office, he told the military to take the gloves off against ISIS. Looking at the scale of U.S. artillery and airpower here, it’s clear that they have done just that.

Outside the final village far in the desert, by the Iraqi border, some ISIS fighters are still trying to escape, hoping to fight another day. Hidden among families, they flee into the surrounding desert, where they are swept up by the Kurds.

We watch as thousands of men women and children emerge from out of the desert fleeing the besieged fighting. They are split into men, women and children – and then the hunt is on to find which ones are ISIS. Many admit to being members of the terror group but say they were just cooks and cleaners – that they never wanted join, but had no choice, and never fought. SDF forces rarely believe them.

FOX NEWS FRONTLINE EXCLUSIVE: FIGHTING THE ISLAMIC STATE IN SYRIA

Among them: ISIS brides. Most claim they were forced to join by their husbands. But their claim is highly doubted.

Their children have attended ISIS schools, indoctrinated from a young age, some have lived under the caliphate for five years. They are known as cubs of the caliphate – it’s a worrying sign for the future – and the big question here is what to do with them.

While ISIS may soon be defeated as a territorial force – what we’ve seen is an indication that many remain.

Arab villages nearby are no-go zones, and there are an estimated 20,000 ISIS followers still at large. Fox News learned a few days ago that the surrounded fighters had asked for safe passage to Turkey in exchange for a ceasefire – the SDF said no. They want these battle-hardened fighters finished off, and now.

It’s the geopolitics that also raises big questions. Once the caliphate falls, and the U.S. pulls out – as President Trump has suggested he’ll do – it’s widely expected that the Turks will move down across their border and attack the Kurds, who they see as terrorists.

And so, without U.S. support, the Kurds say they have no option but to talk to the Assad regime – they believe it’s the only way they’ll remain safe without the U.S. And as if to reiterate the point, just a mile from where we are, south of the frontlines, regime forces are waiting alongside Iranian militias – to move in once the U.S. leave.

The Kurds hope they can rely on the U.S. to offer continued support, and they urge the President to reconsider his decision to leave. They insist they’ve been long and trusted allies of the U.S., fought alongside them on numerous occasions, and lost thousands of men.

They also urge president Trump not to make the same mistake President Obama did, saying he left Iraq before the job was done – and handed that country to Iran.

foxnews,Work begins to remove mammoth 'fatberg' under British town,['Lucia Suarez Sang'],"The mammoth task to clear a giant “fatberg” blocking a sewer in a popular southwestern English resort town is underway and officials said it will likely take months to remove the revolting 210-foot fat mass.

The congealed “monster” of fat, oil, wet wipes, and other trash was discovered in the sewers of the coastal town of Sidmouth in December. Officials said it would likely take about eight weeks to remove.

On Tuesday, staff from South West Water descended into the sewer to remove the first chunk of the “fatberg” and 3D scans were taken of the “unwanted Christmas present,” the BBC reported.

The chunk was brought out in a yellow plastic bucket and a wet wipe poked out of one side of the grey-mess.

On its website, the water provider said sewer works will endure weeks of manual labor “attacking the fatberg bit by bit with shovels and pickaxes” alongside a high-pressure jet to clear the colossal mass.

“Fortunately, the fatberg has had no impact on Sidmouth’s excellent bathing water quality and has been discovered in good time,” South West Water said. “But it doesn't always end this way.”

High levels of hydrogen sulfide and methane in the air means it’s too unstable to risk taking cameras down to film the removal, the water provider said.

“It is the largest discovered in our service history and it will take our sewer team around eight weeks to dissect this monster in exceptionally challenging work conditions,” Andrew Roantree of South West Water said last month. “Thankfully it has been identified in good time with no risk to bathing waters.”

Charlie Ewart, 51 from Plymouth, is said to have found the fatberg while carrying out an inspection of the sewers in Sidmouth.

“I saw it and thought ‘what on earth?’ it was completely unexpected,” he told Plymouth Live. “It's really eerie in that bit of the sewer and it does look like something out of a horror scene, all congealed and glossy and matted together with all kinds of things.""

Follow Her On Twitter']","An International Olympic Committee member has heated up the talk around the Winter Games by praising dictatorships who don’t need to bother getting the people’s consent to stage the events.

“Everything is easier in dictatorships,” said Gian Franco Kasper, referring to the awarding of the 2022 Winter Olympics to China. The Chinese beat out Almaty, Kazakhstan – another country not known for being particularly democratic – for what will be the first Winter Games held in China.

Speaking to the Swiss newspaper Tagez-Anzeiger, Kasper particularly targeted environmentalists – who typically aren’t allowed much to say under dictatorships – as an obstacle in staging the games.

""From the business side, I say: I just want to go to dictatorships, I do not want to argue with environmentalists,"" Kasper said.

While controversial, Kasper’s remarks might reflect what other Olympics officials have been thinking for some time. The 2014 Winter Olympics were held in Sochi, Russia, a controversial selection because of site’s strong ties to Russian oligarchs tied to President Vladimir Putin.

NO TRUMP MEETING THIS TRIP, BUT PUTIN'S STAGE-MANAGING ALWAYS A FACTOR

And the 2018 Winter Olympics were awarded to Pyeongchang, South Kore - but with the aim of drawing in significant involvement of North Korea, another dictatorship. While the North did not host any events at the games, as some had hoped, their high-profile diplomatic presence at the Opening Ceremony was widely hyped by the international media.

While North Korea’s critics and human rights groups decried the country’s glamorized coverage around the game, Kasper and others saw their involvement as a positive.

""The sport can also be a door opener, maybe we made a contribution to the opening of North Korea in Pyeongchang with the united Team Korea,"" Kasper said.

The Olympics site selection process has had a troubled history that goes back decades. Before the 2002 Olympic Games, several members of the IOC were accused of taking bribes from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee during the bidding process. The allegations resulted in the expulsion of several IOC members and the adoption of new selection rules.

While Kasper seemed quite comfortable dealing with some dictatorships, he at least drew a line through some countries accused of widespread human rights abuses.

""I do not want to go to a country, invest in skiing there, while the population starves. That's where I draw the red line. If Qatar applied tomorrow for the Olympics, then I am against (their proposal),"" Kasper said.

Qatar has been criticized by human rights group who accuse it of exploiting a mostly foreign workforce.

Follow Her On Twitter']","For years, conservative politician Joram van Klaveren, advocating alongside outspoken anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders and his PPV party, was known for his vocal criticism of Islam.

Klaveren campaigned ad nauseam in the Lower House against Islam in the Netherlands, calling it “a lie,” and referring to the Quran as “poison.” He also pushed for a ban of the burqa, and mosque minarets.

So his announcement this week that he has converted to Islam came as a shock to many of his former friends, colleagues, and political followers in the Netherlands.

“If you believe that there is one God and that Muhammad was one of the prophets, besides Jesus and Moses, then you are formally Muslim,” Klaveren told a local radio station this week, explaining his change of heart.

CHRISTIAN CONVERT FROM IRAN CONVERTING MUSLIMS IN SWEDEN

Around five percent of the 17 million Dutch population is Muslim, according to the Dutch Central Statistics. And despite the outspokenness of the likes of Wilders, the religion is reported to be gaining in popularity, and predicted to have doubled by the year 2050.

The prominent political figure, who grew up in an orthodox Protestant Christian environment, said he made the switch official in October last year. He said his change of heart came through the process of researching a new book entitled “From Christianity to Islam in the Time of Terror.”

Follow Him On Twitter']","Amnesty International, a leading human rights NGO, is facing criticism after a damning report revealed the organization is suffering from a toxic work environment and is in a “state of emergency” due to rampant bullying, sexism, racism and overworking.

The report, written by the KonTerra Group, found an “us versus them” dynamic and breakdown of trust between senior management and other staff members. Numerous instances of bullying and public humiliation by the management were also found.

“As organizational rifts and evidence of nepotism and hypocrisy become public knowledge they will be used by government and other opponents of Amnesty’s work to undercut or dismiss Amnesty’s advocacy around the world, fundamentally jeopardizing the organization’s mission,” the report read.

“There were multiple reports of managers belittling staff in meetings, deliberately excluding certain staff from reporting, or making demeaning, menacing comments like: ‘You’re shit!’ or: ‘You should quit! If you stay in this position, your life will be a misery,’” it added

The independent report was commissioned by the organization itself after two members of staff died by suicide last year within a period of six weeks. One victim explicitly blamed the stress caused by the workplace.

Gaëtan Mootoo, 65, was a veteran Amnesty International worker, devoting more than 30 years to the charity. He died inside the organization’s Paris office, the Guardian reported, leaving a note voicing complaints about work pressure and management’s lack of support.

Five weeks later, Rosalind McGregor, a 28-year-old intern in Amnesty’s Geneva’s office also died by suicide. While an inquiry into her death noted that she had been troubled due to “personal reasons” and cleared the organization of wrongdoing, her family accused the charity of being a factor in her development of “acute anxiety” during her five-month internship.

The consultants interviewed nearly 475 Amnesty staff members, with many branding the workplace environment as “toxic.”

“Across many interviews the word ‘toxic’ was used to describe the Amnesty work culture as far back as the 1990s. So were the phrases ‘adversarial’, ‘lack of trust’ and ‘bullying’.” — Report on Amnesty International

Staffers also revealed instances of racism and sexism and anti-LGBTQI sentiments in the workplace, with the report concluding that some examples of alleged abuse of power, discrimination and unfair treatment may warrant a further investigation.

foxnews,Electric Ford F-150 possibly caught on camera,"['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.""]","The first electric Ford F-150 may have been spotted, but it’s still a couple of years away from showrooms.

Ford just confirmed in January that it is developing a battery-powered F-150, and a possible prototype for it has already been caught on camera at a Ford development center by an automotive spy photographer.

THE F-150 WON'T BE FORD'S FIRST ELECTRIC PICKUP, IT ALREADY MADE ONE

The truck has the current F-150 body and a tailpipe, but also a few telltales that indicate it is a very electrified vehicle. The biggest giveaway is an outlet in the front bumper with what appears to be a charging cable plugged into it. The cab, which is wrapped in a black and white camouflage pattern to hide its details, is also lifted a bit and has what could be a large battery pack stuffed underneath.

MORE PICKUP NEWS FROM FOX NEWS AUTOS

Ford is also working on a hybrid F-150 that can double as a generator that will offer power for tools and gear, but the thick cable plugged into this one is connected to what looks like a charging station, so the electricity is probably going into it, not coming out.

Ford hasn’t said exactly when the electric F-150 will officially debut, but that likely won’t happen before an expected F-150 redesign in 2021. Tesla is the only other major automaker that has so far announced plans for an electric pickup, and CEO Elon Musk said he may reveal what it looks like as early as this summer, although production is doubtful to start before the new F-150s hit the road.

foxnews,"Tesla Model 3 price cut again, now starts at $42,900","['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.""]","Tesla has lowered the price of its Model 3 by $1,100 amid reports that U.S. sales fell precipitously in January despite a $2,000 reduction that went into effect at the beginning of the month.

The Model 3 Mid Range now starts at $42,900 and features rear-wheel-drive and a range of 264 miles per charge.

The electric automaker has admitted that it is facing challenges to bring the price of the Model 3 down as it aims to offer a long-promised $35,000 version. Elon Musk promoted the new price cut on Twitter by pointing out that it brings the effective cost of ownership below that mark after federal tax credits and fuel savings over a similar gas-powered car.

“The demand for - the demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability. It's just like people literally don't have the money to buy the car,” Musk during the company’s earnings call last week.

Respondents to a recent Consumer Reports survey gave the Model 3 the highest marks for customer satisfaction.

SAFETY GROUPS URGE CAUTION AS ANOTHER POSSIBLY UNCONSCIOUS DRIVER IS SPOTTED IN MOVING TESLA

InsideEVs estimates that Tesla sold 6,500 Model 3s in the U.S. in January, which would represent a more than 70 percent drop from the prior month. Tesla typically only releases global quarterly sales figures, but Musk acknowledged on the call that sales had weakened in January, in part due to a “pull forward of demand” to December by many customers looking to beat a 50 percent cut in the tax credit Teslas are eligible for that occurred at the end of 2018.

Musk also said on the call that the standard, shorter range $35,000 Model 3 may be available in the middle of this year, clarifying that it was a “rough, rough guess,” and that current production is almost entirely earmarked for upcoming deliveries to Europe and China.

The recall covers Ram 3500 pickups from 2013 through 2017, as well as 2500 pickups and 3500 Chassis cabs from 2014 through 2017.

The company says it's aware of eight crashes and one injury that could be related.

Fiat Chrysler doesn't have a date yet for owners to be notified. Dealers will inspect a steering linkage nut. If it's properly tightened, it will be welded to a sleeve to keep it in place. If it's loose, a steering assembly will be replaced.

Most of the trucks are in the U.S. and Canada.

The recall comes after the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in December began investigating steering failures on some Ram trucks. The agency opened the probe after getting two complaints from owners that the linkage between the steering box and the front wheels can come apart.

Owners with questions can call (800) 853-1403 or go to https://www.mopar.com/en-us/my-vehicle/recalls/search.html to find out if their vehicles are included.

foxnews,The 2020 Chevrolet Silverado HD is the strongest pickup in America...for now,"['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.""]","The king is dead. Long live the king. But for how long?

Less than a month after Ram claimed the pickup towing crown with its new line of heavy duty trucks, which have a maximum tow rating of 35,100 pounds, Chevrolet has usurped the throne with its all-new 2020 Silverado HD.

THE 2020 RAM HD IS A MONSTROUS TRUCK:

The Silverado 3500 will be able to pull up to 35,500 pounds when it goes on sale later this year. That’s for a regular cab, rear-wheel-drive dually powered by a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 with a gooseneck hitch receiver.

The news came as a bit of a surprise because the Silverado’s engine is rated at 910 lb-ft of torque just like the outgoing model, while the Ram’s 6.7-liter straight-six cranks out a record-setting 1,000 lb-ft.

But there’s a lot more to towing than just torque.

Trucks are rated on a combination of factors that includes structural strength, acceleration, braking, handling and the ability to climb a grade without overheating while towing a target load.

Chevy chalks up the Silverado’s increased strength to a beefed-up chassis and powertrain that includes a 10-speed Allison-brand transmission, plus improved cooling for the engine courtesy of a new front end design with lots of air intakes and a massive 28-inch radiator fan.

Along with the diesel, the Silverado 2500 and 3500 are available with a new 6.6-liter gasoline V8 rated at 401 hp and 464 lb-ft of torque. Both models get the same cabin that was introduced on the 2019 Silverado 1500, but the only bodywork they share is the roof.

The Silverado HD also has plenty of new features, including a side step for bed access that can support 500 pounds and a 360-degree camera system with 15 views that can make a trailer virtually transparent by depicting what’s behind it in a composite picture.

As far as how long the Silverado HD will stay on the top of the towing heap is concerned, the answer could be coming soon. The updated 2020 Ford F-Series Super Duty was also revealed this week and Ford says it will have a higher tow rating than the outgoing model’s 34,000 pounds, but is waiting a little longer before it says exactly what it is.

foxnews,2018 Jaguar E-Pace Test Drive: Welcome to the family,"['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.""]","The Jaguar E-Pace has an Easter egg painted onto the bottom left corner of its windshield. It depicts a Jaguar with a cub. Cute.

It’s supposed to symbolize the model’s role as Jaguar’s baby SUV to the larger F-Pace. The only problem is, they’re different species.

Although the two look a lot alike -- and are gorgeous for SUVs as far as I and all of the heads they turn are concerned -- an X-ray examination reveals it’s all a façade.

The F-Pace is built on a chassis that’s also used by Jaguar’s sedans and the Range Rover Velar, but the E-Pace is related to the Range Rover Evoque. The F-Pace platform is primarily rear-wheel-drive, the E-Pace front-wheel-drive. There’s no missing link between them, the vehicles are fundamentally unalike.

But they do share a beating heart. Two of them, actually. They’re 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines, rated at 247 hp and 296 hp, and are the only ones offered in the E-Pace, while the F-Pace can also be had with a selection of supercharged V6 and V8 engines, not to mention a diesel.

But the more-powerful version does the trick in both of these urban jungle cats. It’s more than adequate and a good value proposition in the F-Pace, and turns the little E-Pace into something of a muscle machine. You’ll find it bundled in the R-Dynamic trim level, which starts at $47,395, a big jump up from the E-Pace’s starting price of $39,595.

But you get more than power. All USA-bound E-Paces have standard all-wheel-drive, and the R-Dynamic adds leather upholstery, automatic emergency brakes and built-in WiFi. Available options run the gamut from a 360-degree camera to adaptive cruise control and a full panoramic sunroof. Unfortunately, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration costs $300 for the pair, because they are necessities given Jaguar’s so-so native infotainment system. All-in, it’s not hard to tally up more than $60,000, which is a lot for a small SUV, but in line with Jaguar’s luxury competitors.

In keeping with its mixed lineage, the E-Pace features interior styling that borrows a fair amount of DNA from Jaguar’s F-Type sports car. Notably its pistol grip gear shifter and the grab handle on the center console for the front passenger, but also the overall vibe of the design and materials. It's not glitzy and glamorous, and there’s a bit too much bare plastic, but the look is sporty and unique.

On the functionality front, rear legroom is snug and the seatbacks don’t fold perfectly flat, which makes it hard to get the most out of the cargo space. But there’s plenty of it, despite the sloping hatchback.

As far as the ride is concerned, I have to tell you that my first few miles behind the wheel were a little disappointing, but only because I’d literally just stepped out of Jaguar’s new battery-powered I-Pace SUV. It’s about the same size as the E-Pace, but its seamless electric drive and supple air suspension system make its conventional cousin feel like it’s from the Stone Age.

Once I reacclimated, however, the E-Pace revealed a solid blend of comfort, handling and response. It’s not the pure magic you get in pricier Jaguars, but even with the 20-inch wheels and thin tires that the top of the line R-Dynamic HSE rides on it’s never too rough, the steering is lively and the engine makes highway merges a breeze. And while you likely won’t see too many E-Paces intentionally going off the beaten path, those Range Rover bones give it some light off-road chops and the ability to wade through 20-inch-deep water. This is one kitten that’s not afraid to get wet.

All things considered, that Easter Egg is just as much about E-Pace customers as it is about the car, depicting Jaguar’s hope that newcomers who buy this entry-level model will grow with the brand. But that only works if their first experience is a good one.

It was for me.

foxnews,2019 Acura RDX Test Drive: Back to the future,"['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.""]","Second time looks to be the charm for Acura’s third-generation RDX. Allow me to explain that calculus.

When the compact SUV was first introduced in 2007, it was essentially a luxed-up version of the Honda CR-V that was powered by the first turbocharged four-cylinder engine the automaker ever offered in the United States.

But it wasn’t a great one. It was a little weak and rough around the edges, and the RDX didn’t find as many buyers as expected. So when it was redesigned for 2012, Acura swapped in one of its silky naturally-aspirated V6 engines to right the ship. It did, and it was smooth sailing from there.

It quickly moved into a strong second place on the sales charts behind the larger MDX. That looks set to change with the all-new 2019 RDX, which has been the brand’s most wanted since it arrived in showrooms, powered once again by a turbocharged four-cylinder.

ACURA MDX SPORT HYBRID TEST DRIVE:

The engine is one of several turbos spread across the Honda/Acura lineup these days. The 272 hp 2.0-liter comes with a 10-speed automatic transmission and is proof that a decade of hard work can pay off. It’s very good. There’s lots of grunt, and Acura dialed in a deep, rich sound with a digital assist.

The RDX rides on its own platform this time around, one that features a sporty five-link rear suspension and a super stiff structure engineered to give it a premium feel and accommodate a big hole in the ceiling for a standard panoramic sunroof. The wheelbase is longer than a CR-V’s and the richly appointed passenger compartment is a little roomier, but the RDX’s chic roofline cuts into cargo space. The spare tire is mounted beneath the vehicle, however, which may prove to be inconvenient at the worst time possible, but leaves room for a couple of handy storage bins under the floor.

Prices start at $38,295 for a front-wheel-drive RDX, which beats most of its competitors by thousands, and a loaded all-wheel-drive model rings up at $48,395.

Four trim levels are available, with the top of the line Advanced getting a head-up display, computer-controlled suspension system and a pair of heated and ventilated front buckets with adjustable side bolsters and leg supports. They are remarkably comfortable and dressed in high-quality leather. So is the bridge-like center console, which feels so good you just want to wrap your arms around it.

It’s also home for one of the RDX’s signature features, the so-called True Touchpad Interface for the infotainment system. The pad is designed to mirror the screen mounted up on the dashboard so you don’t have to reach for it or draw your eyes too far away from the road. It works well when you’re trying to access icons located in the corners of the screen, but isn’t so accurate in the middle. Swiping through menus or browsing radio stations is a tedious process. Once you have all of your customizable desktops and favorites set up – not something you want to try while driving – it’s not bad, but I never got the sense it was any better than just having a closer, traditional touchscreen with auxiliary knobs like the Accord offers. That said, it’s much better than the similar setup found in some Lexus vehicles, or any dial-style controls.

The RDX does have one of the those, but it’s only for choosing from its selection of Snow, Comfort, Sport and Sport+ drive modes, each modifying the drivetrain’s eagerness, steering feel and suspension stiffness as appropriate. There’s a noticeable difference between them, and I found myself switching to sport anytime the road started getting hilly and twisty. Acura’s been trying to get its groove back, and the RDX has it in this setting. Sport+ is a bit too much for a vehicle like this, as it lets engine rev way too high before it switches gears, (but you’ve got to kick that VTEC in sometimes, bro.)

All things considered, the Ohio-built RDX is an excellent value and a far more engaging car to drive than its archrivals, the Lexus NX and RX, which bookend it in size. Acuras have always been a sensible choice in the luxury SUV segment, and this one ignites more senses than any Acura SUV before it.

So the Insight was put on hiatus a couple of years later, but rebooted in 2009 as a four-door hatchback that looked like a bad copy of the Toyota Prius it was trying to be. Unfortunately, it arrived at a time when Honda was off its game, delivering cars with refinement far below what was expected of the brand. Popular in its Japanese homeland, not even a perfect storm of The Great Recession and the highest gas prices in a generation could turn it into a hit here. Honda put out of its misery at the ripe old age of five in 2014.

Since then, the Insight badges were left sitting on the shelf at American Honda as the Civic and Accord and CR-Z hybrids did their best to take on Toyota in the gas-electric space. Without much luck.

But now, staying true to its decade or so lifecycle, the Insight is back, and you’d never recognize it. It’s based on the platform of the Civic sedan, but has a more sophisticated style than its sibling and none of the visual quirks of its previous generations.

The interior is even more distinct from the Civic and has a high-end feel. There are large puffy inserts in front of the passenger and on the doors, and the driver is treated to an instrument cluster that pairs an analog speedometer with a multi-functional digital display. As with the Civic, the Insight is spacious for a compact and has a low and wide stance.

Priced at $23,725, the Insight falls between the similarly subdued $23,085 Hyundai Ioniq and odder-than-ever Toyota Prius at $24,395 in the hybrid price hierarchy. But its true position among them is tougher to peg.

The Insight’s ride quality is unsurpassed by any car at this price point, regardless of what’s under the hood. It’s smooth around town, composed in curves and sportier than most, if not exactly sporty. It’s also quiet, at least when it’s operating under pure electric power. Which is often, but not often enough.

Honda uses an uncommon drivetrain layout that combines a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine with a unit comprised of a generator and electric drive motor. The motor draws its energy from the lithium-ion battery tucked inconspicuously under the rear seats until the charge gets too low, then summons the four-cylinder to crank the generator. As there isn’t a conventional transmission, there also isn’t any annoying vibration when the engine starts up as there is in most hybrids, which is a boon in stop and go traffic.

There is noise, however. Sometimes lots of it. The engine, which is a little gruff, sets itself at whatever rpm it deems necessary to meet the power demands and just sits there groaning. Going uphill, it’s as if you have your foot to the floor and need to change gears, but don’t. No hybrid is perfect in this regard, but the Insight isn’t even close.

It’s much better suited the Midwest than the mountains. On flat terrain, the engine is used less frequently and runs slower when it is. The payoff for any pain is at the pump. I hit 50 mpg in the top of the line Touring I tested, which has an EPA combined rating of 48 mpg, while lower trims are listed at 52 mpg. That’s short of the Prius and Ioniq, which max out at 56 mpg and 58 mpg, respectively, but both are less powerful than the 151 hp Insight.

All Insight models are well-equipped, and even the EX comes with a standard safety package that includes automatic emergency brakes, lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control, but without Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. The mid-level LX gets those, along with the camera-based Lane Watch passenger blind spot monitor and a 60/40 rear seat pass-through to a large flat trunk made possible by the modern slim battery pack design. Leather upholstery, premium audio, heated seats and those automatic windshield wipers that I know you must have kick in with the Touring at a max price of $28,985.

You’ll spend thousands more on a loaded Ioniq or Prius, so the efficiency advantages are pretty much a wash for your wallet. You’ll have to decide about saving the planet, not to mention your hearing.

cbsnews,Taliban claims U.S. agreed to major Afghan withdrawal in 2 months,"['Tucker Reals', 'Tucker Reals Is The Cbsnews.Com Foreign Editor', 'Based At The Cbs News London Bureau.']","President Trump has made clear his desire to extricate the U.S. military from the ""endless"" war in Afghanistan. He touted ""constructive talks"" the U.S. has been conducting with the Taliban during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Mr. Trump said, ""we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.""

The pace of any U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a major point of discussion -- and concern -- given the strength the Taliban still wields and the group's well-established history of hosting terror groups.

On Wednesday, the TaIiban claimed the Trump administration had agreed to pull half of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan out of the country in just a couple months. The U.S. government denies that any timeline for a withdrawal has been agreed yet with the Taliban.

The direct U.S. talks with the Taliban are a key aspect of a multi-pronged dialogue the Islamic extremist group has engaged in with virtually every party that has a vested interest -- with the notable and problematic exception of the Afghan government.

Afghan peace talks without the Afghans

Negotiations are ongoing this week in Russia, where Taliban officials are sitting down with representatives from Afghanistan -- but from not from the government. The Taliban considers the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani a puppet regime controlled by the U.S., and thus refuses to speak with it.

Analysis: ""No good choices"" in talks with Taliban

Ghani knows his own military forces cannot keep the Taliban at bay on their own. The militants currently control or hold sway over about half the country. Ghani needs the foreign (mostly American) troops there, and with the negotiations continuing largely out of his control, he spoke on the phone after Mr. Trump's speech with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Ghani said Pompeo, ""stressed that there is no uncertainty and ambiguity about the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan and our enduring partnership.""

Ghani said Pompeo had ""also stressed that our military partnership is unwavering and will remain until a lasting and inclusive peace is achieved.""

A Taliban official in Moscow told CBS News on Wednesday that during negotiations with the U.S. in Qatar in January, the U.S. side, led by White House envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, agreed to pull half of the American forces currently deployed in Afghanistan out by the end of April. That would mean a reduction from the current troop level of about 14,000 to 7,000 in just a couple months.

I spoke to Secretary Mike Pompeo (@SecPompeo) over the phone this evening. Reiterating the stance and commitment of the United States, Secretary Pompeo stressed that there is no uncertainty and ambiguity about the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan and our enduring partnership. — Ashraf Ghani (@ashrafghani) February 5, 2019

""The Americans told us that half of the U.S. forces, from 1 February to the end of April, will withdraw from Afghanistan,"" the deputy head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar, Abdul Salam Hanafi, told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai on the sidelines of the talks in Moscow. He insisted the Taliban had never allowed Afghan soil to be used by outside terror groups to plot foreign attacks, and that it wouldn't do so going forward, either.

Another Taliban official was quoted by Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency on Wednesday as saying the U.S. had also agreed that all international forces would eventually leave Afghanistan, but that ""the timeline (for a withdrawal) will be discussed at future meetings.""

Khalilzad reported after the January round of talks in Qatar that his team had agreed on the ""draft of a framework"" for a peace plan with the militant group, but stressed that key points -- including the timetable for a U.S. withdrawal and ceasefire arrangements -- still needed to be hammered out.

One of the remaining sticking points is how and when the Afghan government will be invited to join the peace process. The Taliban has insisted that it will only negotiate a ceasefire with Afghan forces once American troops have left the country.

""The U.S. insisted in their talks with the Taliban that the only solution for lasting peace in Afghanistan is intra-Afghan talks,"" Khalilzad told President Ghani in a briefing after the negotiations in Qatar, according to a readout provided by Ghani's office.

""My role is to facilitate"" such talks between the insurgents and Kabul, Khalilzad said according to Ghani, adding that the discussions were ongoing. The U.S. and Taliban delegations are due to meet again sometime in February.

Can the Taliban be trusted?

The Taliban's top political envoy, who is leading its delegation in Moscow this week, told CBS News partner network BBC News on Wednesday that the Taliban doesn't want to retake, ""the whole country by (military) power.""

""It will not bring peace to Afghanistan,"" Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai told the BBC.

But regardless of how close the Trump administration may be to announcing a final agreement with the Taliban on a ""framework"" for an Afghan peace plan, the deal taking shape is hinged on being able to trust the Taliban to make good on its promises.

That, some senior former U.S. officials have warned, is a mighty leap of faith.

Ryan Crocker, who has served as U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Syria, wrote in a column for The Washington Post in January that the U.S. even sitting down for direct talks with the Taliban was in itself ""surrendering,"" and he warned against trusting the deeply entrenched insurgent group.

""By acceding to this Taliban demand (for talks without the Afghan government), we have ourselves delegitimized the government we claim to support,"" Crocker wrote. ""It was clear that by going to the table we were surrendering; we were just negotiating the terms of our surrender. The Taliban will offer any number of commitments, knowing that when we are gone and the Taliban is back, we will have no means of enforcing any of them.""

Former acting CIA director skeptical about U.S.-Taliban peace talks

Crocker said he hoped President Trump would learn from President Barack Obama's mistake of withdrawing forces from Iraq in 2011, which precipitated the rise of ISIS in the region.

""In Afghanistan, President Trump has a choice. He can follow Obama's example and leave the country to the Taliban, or he can make clear that the United States has interests, values and allies, and will stand behind them,"" Crocker wrote.

CBS News national security contributor Michael Morell, a former acting director of the CIA, also warned against trusting the Taliban, saying the withdrawal of U.S. troops could enable al Qaeda to become a threat again in the country, and abroad.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taliban-us-afghanistan-withdrawal-forces-donald-trump-peace-state-of-the-union/,

cbsnews,Senate votes to end U.S. support for Saudi war in Yemen,['Bo Erickson'],"The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a resolution to end American armed forces' support for the Saudi-led coalition in the country. The bipartisan resolution concerning war powers, approved 56-41, represents the first time ever the Senate has voted to revoke military support from a congressionally unauthorized war.

The Senate also passed an amendment, introduced by GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, to ensure that mid-air refueling between U.S. and Saudi Air Force, which the U.S. suspended last month, does not resume. But there's no chance that lawmakers will stop U.S. support for the Saudis' prosecution of the Yemen war this year because the House will not vote on the measure before the end of the year.

U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict began in 2015 when the Obama administration offered logistical assistance in Yemen to Saudi Arabia's forces fighting against Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran. Senators supporting the legislative maneuver Thursday say the 1973 War Powers resolution forbids logistical assistance like this from the U.S. without congressional approval.

After more than four years of fighting, the death toll is now in the tens of thousands, with many of the dead being children suffering from debilitating malnourishment, according to human rights groups. Tens of millions more Yemenis are displaced.

""In a war waged by adults, it is the country's children who suffer first and suffer most ... thousands of Yemeni children could die from severe malnutrition if conditions, including conflict and economic crisis, do not improve soon,"" Henrietta Fore, executive director of the U.N. children agency, said recently.

Both the plight of these Yemenis and the Senate resolution gained attention in October after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was connected to Saudi Arabia. Support for the resolution was led by a bipartisan group of senators, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.

""What the United States Senate said in a very loud way is that we will not continue to have our military posture dedicated by a despotic, murderous regime in Saudi Arabia,"" Sanders said after the vote.

""When we are putting American treasure, and even more importantly, American blood on the line, it is wrong to entrust that to one person,"" Lee said, arguing that Congress should have its say in war powers.

Six other Republicans joined Lee and Democratic colleagues in supporting the resolution: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Steve Daines of Montana, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Young.

Last week, a similar resolution was introduced in the House by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. But a provision slipped into the farm bill by House Speaker Paul Ryan stipulated that the House would not vote this year on the Yemen resolution.

Senators said they hope Democratic House leadership considers a new resolution next year. The Senate, too, would have to vote again on the resolution.

Earlier in the day the Senate also passed a nonbinding resolution declaring that it holds Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman ""responsible"" for Khashoggi's death. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring at the end of the year, introduced the measure.

Murphy welcomed the bipartisanship of the vote as a positive sign.

""What we showed in this vote today is that Republicans and Democrats are ready to get back in the business of working with a president -- and sometimes against a president to set the foreign policy of this nation,"" the Connecticut senator told reporters.

If passed by the next Congress, President Trump will have to sign and approve the resolution or veto it.

On Tuesday, the president signaled an openness to moving the U.S. away from the conflict. ""Well, I'm much more open to Yemen because frankly, I hate to see what's going on in Yemen,"" Mr. Trump told Reuters, ""But it takes two to tango. I'd want to see Iran pull out of Yemen too...and I think they will.""

However, administration support for the resolution is not guaranteed. In late November, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with Defense Secretary James Mattis, tried to lobby senators to continue the U.S. support of the Saudi coalition. At the time, Pompeo said Yemen would be ""a hell of a lot worse"" if the United States abandoned a role in the Yemen.

American forces continue to provide logistical support and ""certain information"" to the Saudi and Emirati coalition, Mattis said in October.



Talks between Yemen's government the Houthi rebels are currently being held in Switzerland. However, Yemen Prime Minister Abdulmalik Maeen Saeed told CBS News on Saturday that help from America in the future is critical.

""The support of the U.S. is important. The government should be in control of every position in Yemen, the institutions should be rebuilt with security and army,"" Saeed said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-votes-to-end-u-s-support-for-saudi-war-in-yemen/,

cbsnews,George Soros-funded university forced out of Hungary by Prime Minister Viktor Orban,['Haley Ott'],"LONDON -- Hungary's far-right government has forced a United States-accredited university founded by the philanthropist George Soros out of the country, the college said Monday. The school, Central European University, called it ""a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary.""

Central European University (CEU), established in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union, is one of the top-ranked universities in the region. According to the mission statement on its website, one of its aims is to be ""a source of support for building open and democratic societies that respect human rights and human dignity.""

It says it will be moving its U.S.-accredited programs, which account for more than 80 percent of its degrees, to Vienna, Austria.

Monday's announcement came after a drawn-out battle with the increasingly authoritarian government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which has been cracking down on dissent in the country, as well as on organizations with links to Soros, who was born there but is now a U.S. citizen.

""This is unprecedented,"" CEU president Michael Ignatieff said in a statement. ""A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU.""

Orban v. Soros

Soros has been demonized by Orban and his Fidesz party for years, and an anti-Soros narrative made up a large part of their election campaign. They used anti-Semitic tropes to accuse the American billionaire of being behind any number of plots, including promoting illegal immigration.

Soros is Jewish and survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a child before eventually moving to the United States.

Central European University is viewed by Orban as promoting liberal ideals that clash with his vision for an ""illiberal"" Christian democracy in Hungary.

""The government has never even tried to pretend that there were academic grounds for their actions,"" the university's statement said. ""Arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom. It is a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary.""

Earlier this year, Soros' other main operation in Hungary, the Open Society Foundations, moved its headquarters from Budapest to Berlin after the Orban government passed legislation – named ""Stop Soros"" – restricting the ability of NGOs to work on asylum cases.

Drawn-out battle

Legislation passed in 2017, which seemed to be aimed at CEU, required that all universities in Hungary have campuses in their native countries. CEU is an American-accredited institution, but did not at that time have a campus in the U.S. To comply with the law, it formed a partnership with Bard College in New York and negotiated an agreement with the Hungarian government; however the government did not sign the deal.

CEU said it had to announce it was moving its U.S.-accredited programs to Vienna on Monday in order to have time to recruit students for next year.

""CEU is not… an ordinary university, because it has a specific goal… to educate people from the region and from central Asia and so on, for them to go back and democratize,"" Felix Bender, a Ph.D. student in political science at the university, told CBS News. ""It's really ironic that the country that they're in is kicking them out for those reasons.""

The European Commission said it was ""deeply concerned"" by CEU's move. It is expected to put additional pressure on Orban's allies in the European Parliament to isolate him. In September, European lawmakers voted to begin proceedings to punish Hungary for potentially violating democratic norms, partially in response to the government's moves against CEU.

""Other countries… have been closely observing the situation and checking how far one can go in silencing opposition and academics,"" Bender says. ""Now they know: There is no opposition to such methods coming from the side of the EU. And this worries me.""

The Hungarian government dismissed criticism on Monday, however.

""The Soros university is leaving but staying,"" Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, tweeted. ""It's common knowledge that a significant number of its courses will still be held in Budapest. This is nothing more than a Soros-style political bluff, which does not merit the attention of the government.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-soros-funded-central-european-university-forced-out-of-hungary-by-pm-viktor-orban/,

cbsnews,Hunger pushing Maduro's troops to tipping point in Venezuela,['Elizabeth Palmer'],"Caracas, Venezuela -- President Trump made little mention of the crisis unfolding little more than 1,000 miles from the Florida coast in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, but he reiterated his backing of ""the Venezuelan people and their noble quest for freedom."" Mr. Trump condemned the ""brutality"" of the embattled regime of President Nicolas Maduro, whom Washington has declared an illegitimate leader.

The U.S. and almost 30 other nations, along with several regional blocs, have backed the shadow administration of the self-declared ""interim president,"" opposition leader Juan Guaidó. But a standoff between the two sides is still playing out, with major world powers China and Russia backing Maduro.

The Venezuelan armed forces are the kingmakers in the epic power struggle. Everyone in the country is waiting for a sign that the generals are ready to desert President Maduro.

CBS News spoke to a member of the rank and file. At great risk to himself, a junior officer from Venezuela's National Guard, one branch of the military, agreed to talk to on condition that we obscure his identity and voice.

""What we need is Maduro to leave. We must overthrow this government,"" the masked guardsman said.

It's the kind of treasonous talk Maduro doesn't want Venezuelans to hear. Without the armed forces' backing, his reign as leader is finished.

Humanitarian aid struggles to reach Venezuela as political crisis escalates

Pictures broadcast by state TV almost daily make it look as if the armed forces are still firmly on the president's side, but the truth is: the troops -- most paid about $6 a month -- have had enough.

""Because they are tired,"" the guardsman said. ""We are suffering just like the people are. My family, for example, my salary isn't even enough to buy food.""

Asked if he can discuss the complaints back in the barracks, he said, ""Yes, we talk,"" but only with people they trust. The higher ranking officers are not privy to such discussions. He said that's why he insisted on wearing a mask -- ""to protect myself. We have no freedom of expression.""

The fact is soldiers can't feed their families. Like millions of their fellow citizens, they're scraping along in an economy ruined by corruption, neglect and mismanagement.

To convince them and their brass to defect to the opposition, Guaidó has offered them amnesty. But the rank and file need more than that.

""In the National Guard, all we need is a high-ranking general to lead the way,"" the masked guardsman said.

According to BBC News, some of the military's leadership is expected to stay loyal to Maduro because they themselves would be at risk of losing money and could face human rights violations.

The next big test for the armed forces will come as soon as this weekend, when humanitarian aid sent by the U.S. arrives on Venezuela's border. Maduro has ordered the army not to let it in. The national guardsman told CBS News there's every chance they won't obey that order.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-crisis-nicolas-maduros-military-national-guardsmen-troops-fed-up/,

The latest figures mean 2018 ranks as the fourth-hottest year since modern record-keeping began in 1880. Nine of the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2005.

NOAA said the average temperature for the contiguous U.S. in 2018 was 53.5 degrees Fahrenheit, making it a warmer-than-average year for the 22nd year in a row.

The United Kingdom Met Office, the U.K.'s weather service, said global temperatures over the next five years will average somewhere between 58.51 and 59.49 degrees Fahrenheit, or 14.73 to 15.27 Celsius. That would be warmer than the last four years.

During Mr. Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday, he said if he ""had not been elected president,"" the U.S. would be in a ""major war with North Korea.""

""I think there's no question that the United States was headed toward a confrontation with North Korea,"" Pence told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Jeff Glor. ""President Obama reflected on his deep concern about North Korea I know during the transition in conversations with President Trump. And there's no question that was the case.""

Mr. Trump announced during his address he would be meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a second summit later this month. It will take place on Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam.

The two met in 2018 in Singapore to discuss an agreement to start the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But a Department of Defense missile-defense assessment published last month said North Korea still poses an ""extraordinary threat"" to national security. Intelligence officials have warned North Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear arsenal.

Still, Pence said it's important to remember ""how far we've come.""

""The president reflected on that in the State of the Union address. When we came into office, North Korea was firing missiles over Japan.

Michael Morell, former deputy director and acting director of the CIA, told ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday he's most worried that President Trump will ""cut a deal"" with Kim Jong Un on the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that threaten the U.S. — putting the rest of the region at risk.

""'Let's get rid of the ICBMs that threaten the United States and let's not worry so much about the nuclear weapons that threaten the rest of the region' — that's my biggest concern,"" Morell said.

While Morell believes that President Trump does deserve credit for getting the hermit kingdom to the negotiating table, it's important to pay attention to what has happened since that first summit.

""They stopped nuclear testing, but they've made no move at all towards denuclearization. In fact, we know that they continue to do activities on the ground to advance their program and sanctions have weakened as other nations have loosened their restrictions because on things are looking better. And, most importantly, Kim has a seat on the stage,"" Morell said.

President Trump has tried to downplay North Korea's national security threat, writing on Twitter last week, ""North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization.""

cbsnews,"Venezuela showdown could lead to U.S. confrontation with Cuba, says former top U.S. diplomat",['Olivia Gazis'],"The political crisis in Venezuela could lead to a ""confrontation"" between the United States and Cuba, which maintains close ties with Caracas, according to the former top U.S. diplomat in Cuba, Vicki Huddleston.

""I think we're in a very difficult and serious place right now,"" said Huddleston, a former U.S. ambassador to Mali and Madagascar who, from 1999 to 2002, served as the country's top diplomat in Havana under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush.

Huddleston said the two countries' previous leaders, Fidel Castro in Cuba and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, forged a close relationship – helped by a steady flow of subsidized oil – that has endured between the leaders of their present-day regimes.

Though Venezuela's opposition leader and newly recognized interim president Juan Guaidó has benefited from the support pledged by the U.S. and a number of Latin American and European nations, Huddleston said, the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, considered by the U.S. to be illegitimate, could still rely on Cuba – and, by proxy, Russia.

""Cuba's relationship with Venezuela has facilitated a greater presence of Russia,"" Huddleston said in a recent interview with Intelligence Matters host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell. ""As we push with other Latin Americans to see Maduro step down, you have the Cubans, you have the Russians advising him not to step down,"" she said.

""And I don't see that the administration at this point is trying to arrange a soft landing – which actually is the only way out,"" she told Morrell. The only way Maduro would be overthrown, she argued, would be if his military turned against him.

""In order to get this, they have to be assured of some kind of soft landing,"" Huddleston said.

Likely exacerbating some of the tensions was the Trump administration's diplomatic pullback from Cuba, Huddleston said.

Though the previously frosty relationship between Washington and Havana saw a meaningful thaw during the Obama administration, which encouraged a diplomatic opening, Mr. Trump, at the urging of his national security adviser John Bolton, has adopted a much tougher stance.

The administration is currently reviewing whether it will allow a stricter embargo against Cuba to go into effect – since 1996, every president has waived the embargo twice a year.

""I think most Cuba watchers and experts on Cuba believe the policy is now regime change for Cuba, as well as other countries in the world"" she said, citing Venezuela and Iran as examples.

""The most damaging part of this is that it's going to make companies that are considering investment in Cuba hesitate and probably not invest,"" she continued. ""And the end result of this is not only a harsher policy, but Cubans are already in an increasingly precarious situation. Medicines are scarce. Even food is scarce.""

""But the thing that it does more than anything else,"" Huddleston said, ""it will continue to push Cuba in the direction of Russia and China.""

""It's like Russia has come back to the hemisphere,"" she said.

Brussels -- European Council President Donald Tusk took a swipe Wednesday at some Brexit-backers in Britain, wondering aloud what ""special place in hell"" might be reserved for those who had no idea how to deliver the country's exit from the European Union.

With just 50 days to go until Britain is due to leave the EU and concern mounting about a potentially chaotic Brexit, Tusk, who chairs meetings of EU leaders, also appeared to dash any British hopes that the bloc would reopen discussions over the Brexit deal that was overwhelmingly rejected by U.K. lawmakers last month.

""I have been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of plan how to carry it out safely,"" Tusk told reporters after talks with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.

Tusk's comments drew predictable outrage from British Brexiteers. House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom, a pro-Brexit Conservative, said Tusk's remark was ""pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful. ... it totally demeans him.""

And former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""After Brexit we will be free of unelected, arrogant bullies like you and run our own country. Sounds more like heaven to me.""

Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 - the first time a country has ever done so. British Prime Minister Theresa May is due in Brussels on Thursday with what she says is a parliamentary mandate to re-open the withdrawal agreement, sealed after 18 months of intense and highly technical negotiations.

""The EU 27 is not making any new offer,"" Tusk said, adding that the legally binding withdrawal agreement, which May negotiated and backed vociferously, cannot be renegotiated.

Tusk and Varadkar said EU nations were intensifying preparations for a 'no-deal' British exit - a possibly disastrous development that could inflict heavy economic and political damage in the U.K. and the EU alike.

""A sense of responsibility also tells us to prepare for a possible fiasco,"" Tusk said.

The Irish border question



Britain's Parliament voted down the Brexit deal last month, largely because of concerns about a provision for the border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. The mechanism, known as the backstop, is a safeguard that would keep the U.K. in a customs union with the EU to remove the need for checks along the border until a permanent new trading relationship is in place.

The border area was a flashpoint during decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, and the free flow of people and goods across the frontier underpins the peace agreement of 1998.

From the archives: Northern Ireland's ""Troubles""

But many pro-Brexit British lawmakers fear the backstop will trap Britain in regulatory lockstep with the EU, while May's political allies in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party say it imposes barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.

In search of elusive unity, May was meeting Wednesday with the DUP, which insists the backstop must be scrapped, and with other Northern Ireland parties who insist it must stay.

There was little sign that compromise was in sight.

""The prime minister has come here empty-handed, with the same old rhetoric, with no plan, no credibility, frankly no honor,"" said Mary Lou McDonald, president of the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein.

McDonald said the backstop ""is the bottom line"" for keeping the border open.

The EU, which has long regarded the border as the thorniest issue in Brexit talks, is also adamant that the backstop can't be removed. Tusk's appearance alongside Varadkar was the latest signal that the bloc will not abandon member state Ireland, which fears both the economic and political impact of a hard border.

""We will not gamble with peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation, and this is why we insist on the backstop,"" Tusk said. ""Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland, and the U.K. will leave the EU as a trusted friend.""

Varadkar said Britain's political instability ""demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee"" about the border.

During a speech Tuesday in Belfast, May restated her ""unshakeable"" commitment to avoiding a hard border and said she didn't plan to remove the ""insurance policy"" entirely.

""What Parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop,"" she said.

May's government has been searching for a way to overcome lawmakers' opposition to the backstop, by adding a time limit or an exit clause - both of which have been rejected by the EU - or a finding a way to replace border infrastructure with unspecified and untested technology.

Tusk said he hoped May would bring to Brussels ""a realistic suggestion on how to end the impasse.""

Varadkar, for his part, warned Tusk he was likely to face some heat over his ""special place in hell"" comments.

""They will give you terrible trouble in the British press,"" Varadkar appeared to say to Tusk as they shook hands after their comments to the press.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-tusk-says-special-place-in-hell-for-brexit-promoters-without-a-plan/,
cbsnews,Egypt's opposition balks at presidents bid for longer term,[],"People chat and smoke traditional water pipes under an election campaign banner for Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, with Arabic that reads, ""for the sake of the nation security"", in Cairo, Egypt, Saturday, March 24, 2018. AP

Cairo - Egyptian opposition parties have formed a coalition against proposed changes to the constitution that would allow President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to stay in office well beyond the end of his current term in 2022.

Egypt's parliament has given its preliminary approval to the changes, but they would also need to be put to a national referendum.

Abdel-Aziz el-Husseini, a senior leader in the Karama, or dignity, party, said Wednesday that 11 parties had met the previous day and declared their opposition. He says the group has established a ""union for the defense of the constitution"" that includes secular and left-leaning parties and lawmakers.

The Background

El-Sissi led the 2013 military overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president and was elected the following year. He has presided over an unprecedented crackdown on dissent, and was re-elected last year after all potentially serious challengers were jailed or pressured to exit the race.

A constitutional amendment to extend el-Sissi's rule would add to concerns that the country is slipping back into authoritarianism eight years after a pro-democracy uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's nearly three-decade rule.

Parliament speaker Ali Abdel-Al said two-thirds of the general committee endorsed the proposed amendments. The 596-seat assembly - which is packed with el-Sissi supporters - will take a final vote on Feb. 17.

A draft of the proposed amendments, obtained by The Associated Press, shows concerted efforts by the pro-government ""Supporting Egypt"" coalition to consolidate el-Sissi's power. The 64-year-old leader could be allowed to run for a third and fourth six-year term, potentially extending his rule to 2034.

The motion was submitted Sunday after approval by a required fifth of the chamber's 596 lawmakers, the vast majority of whom are el-Sissi supporters.

""In order to maintain stability and to complete the development plans, there is a proposal to extend the presidential term to six years,"" said Abdel-Hadi el-Qassabi, head of the majority coalition in the parliament, which is sponsoring the move.

Abdel-Al said Sunday that the amendments ""are rooted in the interest of both the state and the Egyptian people.""

""Conditions on the ground, the situation in the region and the nation's circumstances have proven that (the current term limits) are unsuitable,"" he said.

Opposition in Egypt

Yasser Rizq, chairman of the state-owned al-Akhbar daily and a close confidant of el-Sissi, has argued in recent columns that constitutional amendments were necessary to prevent Islamist parties from gaining power.

The Muslim Brotherhood group won a series of free and fair elections after the 2011 uprising, culminating in one of its senior figures, Mohammed Morsi, winning the presidency in 2012. Morsi's rule proved divisive, however, and the military removed him from power amid mass protests a year later. Authorities have since outlawed the Brotherhood as a terrorist group and arrested thousands of its members.

Flash Points: New crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt

The government has also jailed a number of prominent secular activists. It has banned unauthorized protests, heavily restricted civil society groups and blocked hundreds of websites.

El-Sissi has repeatedly said he would not stay in office any longer than Egyptians wanted him to and that he was not in favor of amending the constitution's term limits. But opposition parties and media have come under intense pressure during his rule, and political figures who have challenged him have been jailed, fled into self-imposed exile or withdrawn from public life.

The proposed amendments also include the introduction of the role of vice president, a revived senate and the enshrining of a quota of 25 percent for women in the House of Deputies. Also included is ""adequate"" representation for workers, farmers, youth and people with special needs in the legislature.

The motion would give the president the power to appoint top judges and bypass judiciary oversight in vetting draft legislation before it is voted into law.

Many opposition lawmakers and figures have decried the motion, and critics have taken to social media to reject what they see as an attempt to enshrine an authoritarian government.

Opposition lawmaker Diaa Dawood told a news conference Monday that an extension to presidential terms ""contradicts what the Egyptian people have demanded in the two revolutions,"" referring to the 2011 and 2013 uprisings.

""Project to amend Egypt's constitution unfolding & in full throttle,"" Nobel Peace Prize winner and former vice president Mohamed ElBaradei, who left Egypt in 2013, tweeted on Monday.

cbsnews,Why Vietnam for the next Trump-Kim Jong Un summit,[],"Bangkok -- Vietnam's selection as the venue for the second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is largely a matter of convenience and security, but not without bigger stakes.

Washington's goal for the Feb. 27-28 talks is for North Korea to agree give up its nuclear weapons. North Korea frames the issue more broadly, seeking a removal of the ""nuclear threat"" from U.S. military forces in South Korea.

On Tuesday Mr. Trump confirmed in his State of the Union address that he will meet Kim for a two-day summit at the end of February.

""We continue our historic push for peace on the Korean peninsula,"" Mr. Trump said, adding he believed war would have broken out between the U.S. and North Korea had he not been elected.

The high-profile meeting on Feb. 27 and 28 will be the second between the president and North Korea's authoritarian ruler. The two men met for a landmark summit in Singapore in June 2018 and agreed to flesh out details of an agreement to start the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula -- a long-sought but elusive foreign policy goal of American administrations going back to the 1950s.

Historical context

Host Vietnam hopes to boost its diplomatic leverage against its powerful neighbor, China, which contests waters in the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam.

But Vietnam's history as a U.S. adversary that transitioned on its own terms to a dynamic free-market economy under a communist political system suggests a larger meaning for the summit.

""By choosing Vietnam, the two leaders send a strong strategic message to the world that they are willing to make a breakthrough decision to turn an enemy into a friend and together make the world a better place, following the example of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship,"" said Le Hong Hiep, a research fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.

America's past military involvement in Vietnam, whether it's seen as tragic or noble, provides a historically dramatic stage for Mr. Trump to again draw attention to his foreign policy accomplishments.

A safe and secure venue for talks

As a single-party communist state, Vietnam boasts tight political control and an efficient security apparatus, and successfully hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in the central coastal city of Danang and the regional edition of the World Economic Forum last year in the capital, Hanoi.

Trump clashes with intel chiefs over North Korea, ISIS and Iran

""Like Singapore, where they met last time, Vietnam is a very secure place,"" said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""Vietnam's security police are able to keep away crowds of the curious and keep journalists in designated areas.""

Mr.Trump's attendance at the 2017 APEC meeting means ""he's familiar with the country and has good rapport with its leaders,"" Hiebert said.

Safe ground for both leaders

This is friendly turf for Kim. Even though North Korea has remained mired in Cold War isolation while Vietnam's postwar path led toward integration with the globalized economy, the two communist countries share a history of anti-imperialist struggle and ambivalent relations with common neighbor China.

""Vietnam and North Korea have long had fraternal communist ties, so North Korea is familiar with the country and its officials. North Korea would also feel confident that Vietnam's security apparatus could secure Kim's protection,"" Hiebert said.

There's also the bonus that a flight from Pyongyang to a meeting in Vietnam is roughly two-thirds of the six-hour flying time to Singapore, and none of it over hostile territory.

A forward-looking North Korea might learn something from Vietnam's impressive economic growth due to ""bold economic reforms, proactive integration into the world economy, and excellent partnerships with strategic partners, with the U.S. and South Korea among the most important ones,"" said Vu Minh Khuong, associate professor at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a similar point when he visited Hanoi last July after two days of talks in North Korea.

""The leaders of Vietnam realized their country could reform, it could open up and build relationships without threatening the country's sovereignty, its independence, and its form of government,"" he said in a speech to Hanoi's business community. ""I have a message for Chairman Kim Jong Un: President Trump believes your country can replicate this path. It's yours if you'll seize the moment.""

What Vietnam stands to gain

""Vietnam is locked in a pretty intense rivalry with China in the South China Sea, so Hanoi is looking for regional and international diplomatic support as a hedge against Beijing, and hosting a summit like this would certainly strengthen its international profile,"" said CSIS scholar Hiebert.

In particular, helping Washington achieve its Korean policy goals could help fulfill Vietnam's desire for closer relations with the U.S., both to encourage trade and investment and serve as a strategic counterweight to China.

Mr.Trump's abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade group dampened hopes for a takeoff in trade, and Vietnam's poor human rights record, especially its harsh repression of political dissidents, has hurt chances for closer security links.

However, intense media coverage of the summit would attract significant international attention from tourists and investors, said research fellow Hiep.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-summit-vietnam-why-communist-asian-nation-was-chosen/,

A White House official with knowledge of the second summit's planning told CBS News that Vietnam was chosen as the location in part because of its good relationships with both the U.S. and North Korea. The official also pointed to the trajectory of relations between America and Vietnam — which were foes during the Vietnam War but have built a good relationship in recent years — as a hopeful model for potential warmer relations between U.S. and North Korea.

U.S. forces have been deployed in neighboring South Korea since the height of the civil war in the peninsula, which has technically not ended because no armistice was ever signed. Large-scale fighting ceased in the summer of 1953.

The president has recently sought to downplay North Korea's national security threat. ""North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization..."" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last week.

""Time will tell what will happen with North Korea, but at the end of the previous administration, relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen,"" the president added in a follow-up tweet. ""Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference!""

But national security officials in Mr. Trump's administration's have refuted his assertions and continue to highlight the threat of North Korea's nuclear stockpile, as well as Jong-Un's apparent reluctance to reduce it.

A Department of Defense missile defense assessment published in January said North Korea still poses an ""extraordinary threat"" to America's national security. During an annual hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last week, Mr. Trump's own top intelligence officials stressed that North Korea is a threat that shouldn't be ignored.

Mr. Trump has also pointed to North Korea's lack of missile tests since his June meeting with the North Korean leader as evidence of the success of his strategy, but North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly in October there was ""no way"" North Korea would get rid of its nuclear arsenal because it could not trust Washington. Last week, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats testified that North Korea was unlikely to ever denuclearize.

The discovery of the new species of dicraeosauridae, christened Bajadasaurus pronuspinax, was revealed in scientific journal Nature.

A reproduction of its spiny neck was exhibited in the Cultural Science Center in Buenos Aires.

""We believe that the long and sharp spines -- very long and thin -- on the neck and back of Bajadasaurus and Amargasaurus cazaui (another dicraeosauridae) must have been to deter possible predators,"" said Pablo Gallina, an assistant researcher at the state council of scientific and technical investigations (CONICET) and Maimonides University.

""We think that had they been just bare bone structures or covered only by skin, they could have been easily broken or fractured with a blow or when being attacked by other animals,"" he added.

""These spines must have been covered by a keratin sheath similar to what happens in the horns of many mammals.""

Bajadasaurus was a quadruped and part of the wider Sauropod family that lived from the late Triassic period (around 230 million years ago) until the end of the late Cretaceous (70 million years ago).

Amargasaurus cazaui lived in the South American continent around 15 million years after Bajadasaurus and both species were found in the Neuquen province around 1,120 miles south of Buenos Aires. It's the same zone in which Giganotosaurus carolinii, considered the biggest carnivorous dinosaur of all time, was discovered in 1993.

It lived during the late Cretaceous period and could have fed on Bajadasaurus. CONICET said in a statement the spines could have been used to regulate the dinosaur's temperature or even to render it more sexually attractive to a potential mate.

It said Bajadasaurus could have had a fleshy hump between the spines that served a similar role to that of a camel. The Bajadasaurus skull is the best preserved example of a dicraeosauridae ever found.

And what we really saw was that there are millions of children that are not in school but Colombia wants to educate them,"" Kennedy told ""CBS This Morning.""

Kennedy called what's happening in the Latin American country the ""biggest refugee crisis in the world today."" Still, she said she is hopeful, in part because Colombia has signaled that it's willing to educate these displaced children — it just needs the resources.

""The world community has a stake in this, because if we invest in the future of these children and every humanitarian crisis, they'll go home to rebuild their own countries and that's what we really want. We want a stable and prosperous Venezuela and Colombia,"" Kennedy said.

Venezuela controls the largest oil reserves in the world and yet the country is in economic collapse, with inflation averaging 80,000 percent last year under President Nicolas Maduro. A growing number of countries around the world have joined the U.S. in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president, and in calling for Maduro to step down.



What Kennedy said she doesn't understand is why only two percent of the humanitarian aid the U.S. sends is earmarked for education.

""It's a long-term investment, it's not a short-term crisis response … There's nothing more important than having children develop skills, develop their dreams, their hope for the future,"" she said.

""Colombia has open borders … this is a country that is welcoming everyone. Committed to educating them, committed to giving them health care. So I think that that's the kind place we need to invest. We can succeed here and give these people hope and then they can return home and rebuild their own country which is what we all want.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-unseen-crisis-is-education-says-former-ambassador-caroline-kennedy/,
cbsnews,Trump to tap World Bank critic David Malpass to run the bank,[],"The World Bank may be poised for a shake-up with President Donald Trump planning to nominate David Malpass, who has been a critic of the bank, to lead the institution focused on global poverty.

Malpass' selection was confirmed by a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to comment publicly on personnel decisions. Trump is expected to make the announcement later this week.

Malpass, now the undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department, has been an outspoken skeptic of the 189-nation World Bank, a leading source of funding for economic development. The World Bank provides low-cost loans for projects around the world. Among its key missions is helping combat poverty in developing countries.

Malpass has called for curbing the World Bank's financial reach and has criticized its lending to China, one of the bank's leading recipients of aid.

If the World Bank's directors approve his nomination, Malpass would be positioned to overhaul an institution that, he has argued, has become too focused on its own expansion and prestige rather than on the interests of poor countries.

""A host of organizations are creating mountains of debt without solving problems,"" Malpass said in a speech last year. ""Huge organizations like the World Bank and the many multi-lateral development banks have created an environment where their own growth ends up being as important as their clients' growth.""

Having Malpass at the helm of the World Bank would fit a pattern inside the Trump administration of tapping officials to lead institutions whose core missions they have publicly questioned or opposed. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others, have under Trump been led by some of their sharpest former critics.

More broadly, the Trump presidency has defined much of its mission by challenging the global institutions that emerged out of World War II such as NATO and what eventually became the World Trade Organization. The president sees the rules set by these organizations as putting the United States at an economic disadvantage.

Malpass, 62, has straddled the top echelons of government and Wall Street, having worked in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and as the chief economist for the defunct bank Bear Stearns. He also unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination for a Senate seat from New York.

Malpass' public forecasting has at times been misguided and arguably shaped by his political leanings.

In 2007, he wrote on the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal that the ""economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years."" Over the subsequent months, the United States toppled into its worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

In the same editorial, Malpass dismissed the risks from subprime mortgages by saying, ""Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation."" As it turned out, the reckless use of subprime mortgages was the catalyst that ignited the 2008 financial crisis.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders declined Tuesday to confirm that Malpass was the president's pick to lead the institution.

""When the president is ready to make that announcement, he certainly will,"" Sanders said. ""I can tell you if he chooses David, it will be a great choice. Highly respected and a strong member of the team.""

Malpass would succeed Jim Yong Kim, who announced in January that he was stepping down three years before his term was to expire. The final decision on a successor to Kim will be up to the bank's board.

Politico was first to report on the nomination.

The World Bank was founded in 1944 with the task of shoring up the economies of nations devastated by World War II. The first recipient of a World Bank loan was France. The bank, whose leader is nominated by the United States and has always been a U.S. citizen, has since shifted its focus from reconstruction to development, extensively in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Kim's unexpected departure could set up a contentious fight between the Trump administration and other countries who argue that the United States exerts too much influence over the bank, which is based in Washington.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-to-tap-world-bank-critic-david-malpass-to-run-the-bank/,
cbsnews,"Pope Francis confirms priests' abuse of nuns included ""sexual slavery""","['Tucker Reals', 'Tucker Reals Is The Cbsnews.Com Foreign Editor', 'Based At The Cbs News London Bureau.']","Nuns have suffered and are still suffering sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic priests and bishops, and have even been held as sexual slaves, Pope Francis confirmed on Tuesday. The abuse was so severe in one case that an entire congregation of nuns was dissolved by former Pope Benedict.

The scope of the abuse of nuns by clergy members first came to light with the publication at the beginning of February of the monthly Vatican magazine ""Women Church World."" The edition included Francis' own take on the scandal -- long known about by the Vatican but virtually never discussed -- in which he blamed the unchecked power wielded by priests and higher clergy across the Catholic Church for such crimes.

An Associated Press journalist who first reported on the scandal last year asked Pope Francis on his flight home from the Arabian Peninsula on Tuesday whether enough was being done by the Church hierarchy to address the problem.

The pontiff conceded that it was a problem and said more action was needed. He insisted the will to confront the abuse is there, and stressed that the problem is not new, and that the Church has been working to address it for some time.

""It's a path that we've been on. Pope Benedict had the courage to dissolve a female congregation which was at a certain level, because this slavery of women had entered it -- slavery, even to the point of sexual slavery -- on the part of clerics or the founder,"" the pope conceded.

Pope seeks to ""deflate"" sex abuse summit expectations

Alessandro Gisotti, interim director of the Vatican press center, later confirmed to CBS News that the order of nuns dissolved under Benedict was the Community of St. Jean in France. The reason the order was dissolved had not previously been made public.

The Saint Jean order was dissolved in 2005, the first year Pope Benedict served as the head of the Church. He stepped down and Pope Francis took over as pontiff in 2013.

""I would like to underscore that he was a man who had the courage to do many things on this topic,"" Pope Francis said of his predecessor on Tuesday.

The pope confirmed that the abuse of nuns was an ongoing problem, but said it was only in ""certain congregations, predominantly new ones and in certain regions more than others.""

While the pontiff did not provide further detail on Tuesday, nuns in India and Chile, at least, have previously reported abuse at the hands of priests.

Francis told reporters on his flight that the Catholic Church,"" shouldn't be scandalized by this,"" adding that ""there are steps in a process,"" and ""we are working on it.""

Pope Francis will hold summit in 2019 on sexual abuse controversy

The Vatican's new openness in discussing the abuse of nuns comes after years of revelations about clergy abusing children, mostly boys, in their congregations across the globe, and senior clergy members covering up those crimes.

On his last flight home from an international trip, just last week, Pope Francis warned that expectations for an upcoming landmark Vatican summit on clergy sexual abuse should be ""deflated,"" as the problem was unlikely to be resolved through it.

The pontiff's move to lower expectations was likely a disappointment to many Catholics, particularly in the U.S. where the last year has seen a string of revelations about senior church leaders covering up abuse.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-priests-nuns-sexual-slavery-abuse-saint-jean-order-france/,
cbsnews,"Russia says it ""has to"" develop new land-based cruise missiles as nuclear treaty falls apart",[],"Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday said the country must develop new types of missile systems in the next two years after Washington and Moscow ripped up a key arms control treaty. The United States has repeatedly accused Russia of violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement and on Friday President Donald Trump said Washington was starting the process of withdrawing from the treaty in six months.

In a tit-for-tat move on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was also leaving the treaty and beginning work on new types of weapons that would breach the crucial Cold War-era agreement.

Many analysts say abandoning the 1987 treaty could effectively signal the start of a new arms race. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said his country would no ""strive for an arms race, which was characteristic of the era of the Cold War.""

Lavrov added, however, that Russia would, ""of course… use the military and technical means to react to the threats created by"" the U.S. pulling out of the INF.

At a meeting with officials on Tuesday, Shoigu said Russia should develop two new missile systems in the next two years.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, attends a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Feb. 2, 2019. AP

""During 2019-2020 we have to develop a land-based version of the seaborne Kalibr system equipped with a long-range cruise missile which showed good results in Syria,"" Shoigu told defence officials. ""Over the same period we will also have to create a land-based missile system with a long-range hypersonic missile.""

Putin already touted the development -- and a purported successful first test -- of a hypersonic missile in December. He claimed the new weapon can fly at 20 times the speed of sound and manoeuvre up and down, meaning it could breach most U.S. missile defense systems.

Russia has long denied allegations from the U.S. and its NATO allies that a new missile in the Russian arsenal, the SSC-8, violates the terms of the INF for having a maximum range greater than 310 miles. Russia insists it can only fly 298 miles. It was the development of that missile, which the Russians call the Novator 9M729, that prompted the U.S. decision to abandon the INF treaty.

Russian Defense Ministry officials show off Russia's new 9M729 cruise missile (known in the U.S. as the SSC-8) at the military Patriot Park outside Moscow, Jan. 23, 2019. Getty

That same weapons system may be one of the missiles Shoigu alluded to on Tuesday when he ordered defense officials to extend the maximum range of ground-based missiles, ""that are being developed today.""

Europe, NATO, and why arms treaties matter

The U.S. has shared intelligence with its NATO allies that Washington says proves Russia's SSC-8 missile could give Moscow the ability to launch a nuclear strike in Europe with little or no notice.

In his annual end-of-year news conference, Putin warned of the growing threat of nuclear war, telling journalists in Moscow that, ""the danger of the situation (with the U.S. withdrawal from INF) escalating is being downplayed.""

""If something like this would happen, it might lead to the collapse of the entire civilization,"" he said, adding that he believed, ""humanity would have the necessary common sense in order to avoid any extremities.""

Defense experts say that because ground-based intermediate-range missiles are cheaper than sea and air-launched versions, Russia could theoretically place more of them within range of European targets.

Speaking to Shoigu on Saturday, Putin said Russia would not put any such missile ""in Europe or other regions of the world,"" unless the United States did so first.

With U.S. backing, Estonia tells Russia ""we are ready to fight""

Tension between America's long-time European allies and Russia has increased significantly in recent years, driven largely by Putin's decision to unilaterally annex the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.

America's role as a co-defender of the peace in Europe is cemented in the tenets of the NATO alliance. Mr. Trump has made European allies nervous since his presidential campaign in 2016 with remarks questioning the relevance and viability of that alliance, but after getting America's partners to agree to increase their funding of NATO, he claimed to have strengthened it.

Since the Cold War, the INF agreement has forbidden Russia or the U.S. from having ground-launched, short- and intermediate-range missiles, but not those launched from the air or sea. Defense experts say converting seaborne and air-launched missile systems for ground use will be advantageous for Russia since producing such missiles will be cheaper and quicker.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-has-to-develop-new-land-based-missiles-inf-nuclear-treaty-us-falls-apart/,
cbsnews,"As hard Brexit looms, stockpiling goods hits high gear",['Sarah Min'],"With less than two months until the U.K. is scheduled to leave the European Union, British and European businesses and consumers in the U.K. are preparing for the possibility of a hard Brexit -- lacking an agreement with the EU -- by stocking up on inventory.

If the U.K. exits the EU without a formal agreement that eases the transition away from the single-market trading relationship it has had with the 27 other member states, that could mean trade delays, higher import prices and supply shortages.

Stockpiling goods

For retailers, stockpiling consumer goods is an efficient way to get ahead of any shifting customs regulations. ""There are low-cost ways for people to hedge their bets,"" said Michael R. Englund, economist at Action Economics.

French luxury house LVMH said in its January earnings call that it's preparing for a ""worst case scenario"" and stockpiling four months of champagne and cognac in the U.K. Unilever, which owns both Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Magnum bars, announced last week that it's keeping several weeks' worth of ice cream on reserve.

Food suppliers warned, however, that they can keep certain food staples at hand for only so long. British retailers Marks & Spencer and Tesco are shoring up on nonperishables, prioritizing food items with a long shelf life over fresh foods.

Stockpiling is also only a temporary solution because supply will likely get more expensive when customs regulations finally coalesce. While the U.K. is the second-largest importer of German sweets after France, those imports will likely slow after the new customs regulations are in place. A slowdown in consumption will likely lead to lost jobs in Germany.

""It's really important that the government pushes forward and gives up the information we need to be able to plan for the future,"" Sandra Sullivan, the director of the British Food and Drink Association, told the Associated Press.

Growing exhaustion in U.K. over Brexit

Fears of prescription drug shortages

Britons are also stocking up their medicine cabinets to last the foreseeable future. For those who rely on monthly prescriptions, the consequences of a shortage in supply is even more dire because three-quarters of medicine used by the U.K.'s National Health Service come from the E.U.

Last year, Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, pushed through plans to stock up on six weeks worth of medicine by purchasing 5,000 refrigerators and securing warehouse space.

""It's creating uncertainty for businesses on the form that Brexit will take, and there's no way to reduce that uncertainty at all,"" said Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

While British Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing for a softer Brexit, meaning closer trading ties with the E.U. and a transition period to adjust trade rules, the lack of clarity on what form a Brexit deal will take is frustrating plans to prepare.

Said Véron: ""You have to plan for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.""

cbsnews,How hunger is fueling Venezuela's fast-rising opposition,[],"Caracas -- Europe has now joined the movement against embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, which continues to grow outside the South American nation. Inside the country, millions of Catholics have also joined the push for change, led by their church. In January, bishops called Maduro's presidency illegitimate.

CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer has visited a parish in La Vega, a working class slum of Caracas, where Mass not only fills the church, it draws an overflow crowd.

Father Alfredo Infanta's spiritual message carries a strong political subtext, though he says it's not directly anti-Maduro, as people must decide for themselves. The Church, however, has called Maduro's presidency unconstitutional. His parishioners might call it something else: a disaster.

Father Infanta took Palmer deeper into the La Vega slum, where there's been no running water for four months and where, if not for a free lunch program offering potatoes, cheese and a dose of vitamins, some kids wouldn't eat at all.



Opposition leader Juan Guaidó lays out vision for Venezuela

Average inflation last year reached a surreal 80,000 percent. Almost no one in La Vega -- or anywhere in Venezuela -- can survive on what they make from work. The economy is so broken that an average teacher's salary, about $6 a month, will only buy a few dozen eggs. Almost half the population of Venezuela would go hungry without charity or food handouts.

Meat is a treat. Ask Enrique the butcher, who sells the cheapest cuts to people lucky to be able to buy once a week. Politically, he's an exception here; he's still loyal to the government.

Asked who he believes is the legitimate President of Venezuela, Enrique says that he believes, along with ""90, 95 percent of Venezuelans, that it's our commander, Maduro."" He's furious the U.S. has got involved, and says every country the U.S. has ""helped,"" has ended up with misery and destruction.

But that's an opinion you hear less and less; Enrique is actually in a shrinking minority.

Recent polls show more than 80 percent of Venezuelans want Maduro to quit. They agree with the Church, that the President has lost his legitimacy, and he has to go. That sentiment, eager for change, is getting more and more common, especially as huge quantities of humanitarian aid from the U.S. nears Venezuela's borders.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-crisis-more-european-nations-back-opposition-leader-juan-guaido/,
cbsnews,Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says he's considering independent run for president,['Scott Pelley'],"Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz left his company seven months ago which led many to wonder what the socially conscious executive was planning. To Schultz, Starbucks was never just a coffee shop. He saw his stores as meeting halls where customers came to chew over the great issues of the day. His activism is rooted in a rags-to-riches life. And tonight, Schultz reveals traumas he has never discussed publicly. At the age of 65, he is preparing for the greatest challenge of his life. Many believe that Schultz would run for president as a Democrat. His announcement tonight may come as a surprise.

""I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win.""

Howard Schultz: I am seriously thinking of running for president. I will run as a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system we're living at a most-fragile time not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged, every single day, in revenge politics.

Scott Pelley: Why run as an Independent? Your views have always aligned with the Democratic Party.

Howard Schultz: That's true. I've, you know, I've been a lifelong Democrat. I look at both parties-- we see extremes on both sides well, we are sitting, today, with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example, not only of Republicans, but of Democrats, as well, as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.

Scott Pelley: Do you worry that you're going to siphon votes away from the Democrats and, thereby, ensure that President Trump has a second term?

Howard Schultz: I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person, who will embrace those ideas. Because I am not, in any way, in bed with a party.

Correspondent Scott Pelley speaks with Howard Schultz

We met with Howard Schultz this month in his adopted hometown of Seattle. It was here, in 1981 that he arrived as a stranger in the Pike Place Market to visit the original Starbucks, just a tiny store that sold coffee beans.

Scott Pelley: You were selling coffee makers, living in New York, and this was one of your customers. Why did you come out here to visit them?

Howard Schultz: The thing is, I had never heard of Starbucks. And they were buying a ton of these products. And I just thought I gotta come to Seattle and see who this company was.

How he created the phenomenon we know is a story longer than the line at Starbucks. Suffice to say Schultz got a job behind this counter. He installed an espresso machine. And in 1987, with borrowed money, he bought the shop.

Scott Pelley: How many stores are there today?

Howard Schultz: Almost 30,000 in 77 countries.

A sweet success with a few bitter notes. Starbucks almost went broke in the 2007 financial crisis.

And last year, a store manager set off a furor when she called police on African-American men who were just hanging out at a table. Schultz closed all the U.S. stores for hours of racial bias training. Race had been an issue even before, when Schultz asked employees to talk to customers about racial justice.

Howard Schultz: We had a moral obligation as a company to discuss this.

Scott Pelley: And, then, you were excoriated for having a coffee shop tell people what it thinks about humanity.

Howard Schultz: The execution was flawed. And who owns that execution? I do because I was the one who was pushing us to not play it safe.

But from the beginning his 350,000 employees caught a break with Schultz's social agenda.

They enjoy health insurance, tuition aid and stock.

Schultz likes to say he created the company his impoverished parents never had the chance to work for.

Howard Schultz: When I read statistics that says that over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank and only a crisis away from bankruptcy, or that five and a half million kids in America, many of whom are African American and Latino, are not in school and not in work and don't have a chance, and one out of six people in America are food insecure, this is what I think about.

Those grim numbers describe his own childhood.

Howard Schultz: This place has never left me. I think it has defined my character, my vulnerability

Schultz took us back in time to his boyhood home,

Scott Pelley: And this is the way up to the seventh floor.

A Brooklyn, New York, public housing project. His family was already poor when his father was injured on the job. With no insurance, they were destitute. And bitterness led to violence.

Scott Pelley: Your father beat you-- with his fists.

Howard Schultz: There were moments where there was physical abuse, yes.

Scott Pelley: He beat you up, when you were taking a shower. And you ended up crumpled on the floor of the shower, watching your blood go down the drain. At that moment, you thought what?

Howard Schultz: I was 15. I was disrespectful to my mother. He came home and-- beat me to a pulp. I couldn't go to school for a couple days. I was angry, upset.

Scott Pelley: Did you hate him?

Howard Schultz: I'm sure there were moments when I did. And then there were glorious moments of being in the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium with him. There is a level of hate that does emerge. But it didn't stay.

His journey is mapped in a new autobiography titled ""From the Ground Up.""

Scott Pelley: If your father was the darkness, your mother was the light.

Howard Schultz: She was. And my self-esteem came from my mother. And I could say that if-- if my mother was here, if my mother-- for her, it would just be the greatest moment of her life, to think. Because one of the things that is, has been so hard for me is that both my parents didn't-- did not see my success at Starbucks. maybe I'm here because of her.

Scott Pelley: Well, let me see if I can find out where you are on some of the issues that are pressing in the country. Immigration.

Howard Schultz: The country first and foremost is based on humanity, fairness, goodness, we have been for 200-plus years a country of immigrants. And for the 11 million people here unauthorized, there should be a fair and equitable way for them to get in line, pay the taxes, pay a fee, and become citizens of the United States.

Scott Pelley: Climate change.

Howard Schultz: Tremendous mistake, again, by President Trump, to leave the Paris Climate Accord.

Scott Pelley: Health care.

Scott Pelley: Every American deserves the right to have access to quality health care. But what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford.

Scott Pelley: The 2018 tax cut.

Howard Schultz: I would not have given a free ride to business, from 35 percent or 37 percent to 21 percent. It would've been more modest. But I would've significantly addressed the people who need tax relief the most, which is the people I talked about earlier, who don't have $400 in the bank.

Scott Pelley: Many people are going to ask what does the coffee entrepreneur know about being commander in chief?

Howard Schultz: I have a long history of recognizing, I'm not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems, I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled, and we've got to create an understanding that we need a creative debate in the room to make these kind of decisions.

His world view is shaped by his experience as a global CEO.

Howard Schultz: Is it in our national interest to have a fight with Mexico, Canada, the EU, China, NATO? Is it in our interest? Give me a break. No, it's not in our interest. These are our friends. These are our allies. We are much better, as a country, being part of the world order.

Sheri and Howard Schultz

Schultz formed his alliance with his wife Sheri when they were married more than 36 years ago. Today, they have a son and a daughter, two grandchildren and another on the way. Sheri schultz oversees the family's $200 million charity that links disadvantaged youth and veterans to jobs.

Scott Pelley: This is a long, rocky road, running for president. Is this something you wanna do?

Sheri Schultz: Well, it, it wasn't in my plan, my long-term life plan for sure.

Scott Pelley: Did he tell you or did he ask you?

Sheri Schultz: No, he asked. He came to the family. We knew it was serious--

Howard Schultz: I'm still-- I'm still asking.

Sheri Schultz: He's still asking and many family meetings.

He's still asking himself whether to run. But he has assembled a campaign team and he's done the homework.

Scott Pelley: Can you get on the ballot in all 50 states?

Howard Schultz: If I decide to run for president, not only will I be on the ballot of every state, all 50 states, but we'll be on the ballot in every county, in every district, that we have done that work.

Scott Pelley: Would the stores be part of this? Is there going to be a Schultz 2020 button on every green apron across the country?

Howard Schultz: Uh, no there would be a complete separation between me and the company.

Scott Pelley: What we know is that no independent has ever come close to winning.

Howard Schultz: What we know, factually, is that over 40 percent of the electorate is either a registered Independent or currently affiliates themselves as an Independent. Because the American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice.

Scott Pelley: What effect do you think being Jewish would have on your campaign?

Howard Schultz: I have great faith in the goodness and kindness of the American people. We elected an African-American president. I'm old enough to remember in 1960 when John F. Kennedy was running and there was an outcry of hate that no one Catholic should be president. I am Jewish, I have faith in God. I am not running as a Jew if I decide to run for president I'm running as an American who happens to be Jewish.

Scott Pelley: Your net worth is something close to $3.5 billion and Forbes magazine would tell you that that's more money than Donald Trump has. Are you willing to spend what it takes to win?

Howard Schultz: Well, I'll say it this way we'll be fully resourced to do what's necessary.

Scott Pelley: Winning could cost $300 million, $500 million. Do those numbers change your mind?

Howard Schultz: No.

Scott Pelley: Would you release your tax returns?

Howard Schultz: 100 percent. Yes.

Scott Pelley: Well, Donald Trump said that.

Howard Schultz: I will. We can do it today, if you want Scott.

Decades ago, housewares salesman Howard Schultz fell for the traditions of Seattle's Pike Place Market. Some traditions slimier than others. Now he's challenging tradition, asking whether Americans want to toss old politics into fresh hands.

Scott Pelley: You know it's 'on' after this interview. President Trump is gonna be tweeting by about 8:00 Eastern Time.

Howard Schultz: You know, I'm –

Scott Pelley: Gonna say terrible things about you.

Robbie Schingler: We took a satellite that would be the size of a pick-up truck and we shrunk it. We wanted to make it about the size of a loaf of bread.

Robbie Schingler began building satellites 20 years ago, working for NASA.

Robbie Schingler: The way that I grew up-- at NASA is we would spend about five to ten years, even-- to build one satellite.

Now he's one of the founders of Planet Labs.

Robbie Schingler: This is our satellite manufacturing building.

A company that turns out satellites in months not years.

Robbie Schingler: You can pick these up. They're about 12 pounds or five kilograms.

Correspondent David Martin with Robbie Schingler

Packed with some of the same electronics used in smartphones, they're built by hand in a nondescript building in downtown San Francisco.

Robbie Schingler: It looks like a warehouse and our engineers here build and operate the largest fleet of satellites in human history.

David Martin: That's a pretty big statement: ""largest fleet of satellites in human history.""

Robbie Schingler: I know. Isn't that cool? And frankly we're just getting started.

David Martin: How many have you built over the years?

Robbie Schingler: Oh, over the years, we've built about 300 satellites. Over the years. And last year we launched about 146 satellites into space.

The satellites are called doves. Here on the production floor they are kept in ""nests,"" waiting to be launched in ""flocks.""

Robbie Schingler: This is a visualization that shows every satellite that we have up in space today.

David Martin: This is mission control?

Robbie Schingler: This is mission control, yeah.

David Martin: It's a little bit of a letdown.

Robbie Schingler: It's a little bit non-traditional. A-- a normal mission control you will have dozens and dozens of engineers for one satellite. We flip that around, so we have dozens of satellites for a single engineer.

Can commercial satellites be used for espionage?

The satellites orbit the globe every 90 minutes while the Earth rotates beneath them, their cameras documenting the planet as it's changing.

Will Marshall: I'm always astonished that almost every picture we get down, we compare it to the picture from yesterday, and something's changed.

Will Marshall is another of the company's founders.

Will Marshall: We see rivers move, we see trees go down, we see vehicles move, we see road surfaces change and it gives you a perspective of the planet as a dynamic and evolving thing that we need to take care of.

David Martin: Is that what people are supposed to conclude from seeing all this change?

Will Marshall: Well, you can't fix what you can't see.

That kind of save-the-world ambition carries a big risk, especially for a small firm that's just getting started.

Will Marshall: Planet has many records. We've launched the most satellites in the world ever, but we've also lost the most satellites ever.

Four years ago, Marshall gathered his staff in what planet calls the ""mothership"" to watch a rocket carrying 26 doves blast off.

Will Marshall: It was a big deal. And we had a customer in the audience at the time that we had brought to see a launch. It was really embarrassing.

Will Marshall

Chester Gillmore: I'll never forget it we see the, you know, smoke coming and everyone's cheering and then it goes, and then ka-boom.

Chester Gillmore runs Planet's satellite assembly line.

David Martin: You lost how many satellites?

Chester Gillmore: Twenty-six, I think we lost, yeah, 26 (makes explosion sound).

David Martin: Those are your babies.

Chester Gillmore: They were. That was a tough, yeah, they were.

David Martin: How long did it take to get back to normal?

Chester Gillmore: We didn't even skip a beat when that happened, didn't lose a day.

On the day we visited Planet its satellites were beaming down 1.2 million pictures every 24 hours.

Planet sells images to over 200 customers, many of them agricultural companies monitoring the health of crops. But this is Planet's most important customer.

Robert Cardillo shows correspondent David Martin around the NGA operations center

Robert Cardillo: So, this is our operations center. Heartbeat of the agency.

Robert Cardillo is director of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, NGA for short, the organization which analyzes satellite photos.

David Martin: So this really is ground zero for all the intelligence coming in from space?

Robert Cardillo: That's correct. It's-- it's where we bring in all of our sources, whether they come from space or any source. But, correct, it's ground zero.

Because 60 Minutes was allowed into this secure operations center, top-secret high-resolution pictures taken by spy satellites are nowhere in sight.

Robert Cardillo: Across the center. You see one of the outposts that the Chinese have developed in the South China Sea.

Cardillo says lower resolution images like this one are taken by commercial satellite companies are changing his world by giving him more and more looks at the Earth, especially places U.S. spy satellites are not zeroed in on.

Robert Cardillo: I'm quite excited about capabilities such as what Planet's putting up in space.

Planet is a small company with just over 400 employees, many of them in San Francisco. NGA is a government bureaucracy with a workforce of 14,500 and a 2.7 million square-foot headquarters south of Washington, D.C. But Robert Cardillo knew a revolution when he saw one.

Will Marshall: This is not a scale model. This is the real size.

When Planet's Will Marshall unveiled his small satellite at a 2014 Ted Talk, Cardillo showed the video to his work force.

Will Marshall: It's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet.

And a radical new culture. Planet openly markets its images. NGA's spy photos rarely see the light of day. The intelligence analyst who leaked these photos of a Russan shipyard in 1984 went to prison. What NGA can see from space is top secret.

David Martin: How many of these high resolution satellites do you operate?

Robert Cardillo: I'll not comment.

Robert Cardillo

But much of what Cardillo won't talk about is common knowledge to Ted Molczan, who is a household name in the obscure world of amateur satellite tracking.

David Martin: How many photo satellites does the U.S. have in orbit?

Ted Molczan: Currently there are three.

Since we interviewed Molczan, what looks like a fourth photo satellite has been launched. He tracks them from his balcony in downtown Toronto with nothing more sophisticated than $300 binoculars.

David Martin: You just wait for a fly-by...

Ted Molczan: Yeah.

David Martin: ...from a satellite.

Ted Molczan: Yeah. I'm laying in wait.

David Martin: For something that's 150 miles away going five miles a second.

Ted Molczan: Yes. And it will cross my field of view in a few seconds. So I've gotta be on the ball.

Here's what a top secret satellite looks like from Earth, captured on video by one of about 20 amateur trackers around the world.

Ted Molczan: Its code name is Crystal. This thing is about the size of a city bus.

David Martin: And this is what it looks like from Earth?

Ted Molczan: That's right. It just looks like a moving star.

The satellite trackers watch as it streaks across the sky, measuring its position against well-known stars.

David Martin: That's enough to tell the orbit of the satellite?

Ted Molczan: Yes. We're doing this with our eyes, often with cameras, but the end result of it is numbers. And if we pool enough of that data together, we can actually calculate the orbit to great precision.

David Martin: If you've been able to calculate this, presumably the North Koreans have been able to calculate this.

Ted Molczan: Absolutely, yes.

David Martin: So there's no mystery to the North Koreans, the Russians, the Iranians, the Chinese when these satellites are overhead taking pictures?

Ted Molczan: That's right.

Ted Molczan with his binoculars

It's space-age hide and seek. Adversaries know when and where American spy satellites are looking but can never be sure what they're finding.

Robert Cardillo: This is what NGA developed in the pursuit of Osama bin Laden.

Before President Obama and his national security team, including Cardillo there on the left, gathered in the White House Situation Room on the night of the raid, NGA had gone back in time through seven years of satellite imagery to construct this scale model of Bin Laden's hideout.

Robert Cardillo: We had historic imagery of this compound that enabled us to reverse time.

NGA could see not just the outside, but inside as well.

Robert Cardillo: It enabled us to go back to the point of construction. And essentially through our imagery archive to rebuild the house so, we could see how the first floor was designed and how the rooms would lay out, where are the stairs from the first to the second floor and the second to the third floor.

David Martin: So old pictures show that building before the roof went on?

Robert Cardillo: We had pictures before the compound existed. We saw it when it was first constructed and as it, as it was built over time. Correct.

David Martin: And that's how you could find out the dimensions of each room?

Robert Cardillo: Indeed.

The satellites that made that possible are the equivalent of a Hubble Space Telescope. But instead of taking pictures of the heavens they are zeroed in on Earth, able to make out objects just four inches across.

For decades they have been indispensable to knowing what America's adversaries are up to, but like Hubble they cost billions of dollars each. Which is one reason there are so few in orbit.

David Martin: Are they putting more up?

Ted Molczan: They've never had more than four up at a time.

Which is why Cardillo is so interested in Planet and its small satellites that deliver a tsunami of data like NGA has never seen.

David Martin: How many analysts would it take to keep up with those number of satellites?

Robert Cardillo: We did some calculations and we came up with six million humans would need to be hired to exploit all the imagery that we have access to. You can see that it's not exactly a viable proposition.

Shawna Wolverton: If you were trying to find this in Syria, it's sort of, like, a needle in a haystack, right?

Planet's Shawna Wolverton showed us how a computer can be programmed to help track the impact of Syria's Civil War on the people who live there.

Shawna Wolverton: So, what we've done is created a algorithm that looks for new roads and buildings.

An algorithm that rifled through reams of satellite photos and identified the first signs of a new refugee camp.

Shawna Wolverton: Here's that first image.

David Martin: So, that red grid is what?

Shawna Wolverton: Those are new roads. And all of these blue spots that you can see here are buildings.

David Martin: So, this is one little corner of, of Syria. Could you do this for the entire country?

Shawna Wolverton: We can absolutely do this for the entire country. I can show you over here. We can zoom out. And you can see that we've run this algorithm over the entire country and you can see all of the roads and buildings.

This is the first photo an American spy satellite ever took from space, in 1960. A far off look at a Russian airfield. Since then we have gotten much more spectacular looks at Earth, like these taken by the Apollo astronauts. But the U.S. government no longer holds a monopoly on photos from space and has no power to stamp top-secret on any of the 800 million images Planet has taken in its brief lifetime.

David Martin: Making it available to everybody, people are going to come up with uses of that imagery that you haven't...

Will Marshall: Yeah.

David Martin: ...imagined.

Will Marshall: Dreamed of, yeah.

David Martin: And not all of them are going to be good.

Will Marshall: No.

David Martin: You worry about that?

Will Marshall: I worry a lot and we wouldn't have started Planet if we didn't have a very strong conviction that the vast majority of the use cases are very, very positive.

cbsnews,How a retired couple found lottery odds in their favor,[],"Last year, Americans spent more than $80 billion playing state lotteries, that's around $250 for each citizen, more than what was spent on concerts, sporting events and movie tickets combined. Over 25 states took in more from their lottery proceeds than from corporate income tax. Because of these stakes, it's essential that, in both perception and reality, lotteries are truly games of chance, everyone entering with an equal opportunity to win. Which is why investigators took note when a retired couple from Michigan, Jerry and Marge Selbee, made $26 million winning various state lottery games dozens of times. This is not a story, though, of a con, or a scam, or an inside job. No, this is a ballad of a couple from small-town America who did something that most people only dream of. They didn't so much as beat the lottery odds as they figured them out.

For years, high school sweethearts Jerry and Marge Selbee lived a quiet life in Evart, Michigan, population 1900. A single-stoplight factory-town that collapses in the folds of a map.

Together they raised six kids and ran a local convenience store on Main Street. Jerry handled the liquor and cigarettes and Marge kept the books and made the sandwiches.

Marge and Jerry Selbee

Jon Wertheim: How long did you have the store?

Jerry Selbee: 17 years.

Jon Wertheim: 17 years?

Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh.

Jon Wertheim: Every day?

Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh.

Marge Selbee: Every day.

Jon Wertheim: Why'd you decide to sell it?

Jerry Selbee: I was 62. Marge was 63. And I thought it was a nice time to sell and see what we could do after that.

Jon Wertheim: You're in your early 60s, you decide to retire.

Both: Uh-huh.

Jon Wertheim: You're gonna put your feet up. What was the plan?

Jerry Selbee: Yeah (chuckle) that was basically it.

Marge Selbee: I don't think we had one per se.

Jerry Selbee: That was basically it. We were gonna enjoy life a little bit.

Jerry and Marge bet big. Now Hollywood is calling

But one morning in 2003, Jerry happened to walk back into the corner store and spotted a brochure for a brand new lottery game called Winfall. Jerry always possessed what he calls, ""a head for math."" He has a bachelor's degree in the subject from nearby Western Michigan University. And in only a matter of minutes, he realized that this was a unique game.

Jerry Selbee: I read it and by the time I was out here I knew what the potential might be.

Jon Wertheim: It did not take you weeks to suss this out?

Jerry Selbee: No, no, not at all. Three minutes.

Jon Wertheim: Three minutes and you found the loophole in the state lottery?

Jerry Selbee: Three minutes. I found-- I found a special feature. (laughs)

That feature was called a ""Rolldown"", and the lottery announced when it was coming. Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of where the jackpot keeps building until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Winfall, if the jackpot reached $5 million, and no one matched all six numbers, all the money 'rolled down' to the lower-tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched five, four or three numbers.

Sound complicated? Well, it wasn't to Jerry. See if you can stick with him here.

Jerry Selbee: Here's what I said. I said if I played $1,100 mathematically I'd have one 4-number winner, that's 1,000 bucks. I divided 1,100 by six instead of 57 because I did a mental quick dirty and I come up with 18. So I knew I'd have either 18 or 19 3-number winners and that's 50 bucks each. At 18 I got $1,000 for a 4-number winner, and I got 18 3-number winners worth $50 each, so that's 900 bucks. So I got $1,100 invested and I've got a $1,900 return.

Jon Wertheim: Sounds like good math

Jerry Selbee: That's-- yeah (laugh) a little over 80 percent isn't it?

Jon Wertheim: You're talking about this as if it's the most obvious set of figures in the world

Jerry Selbee: it is. (Chuckle)

Jon Wertheim: This is not taxing the outer limits of your math skills.

Jerry Selbee: No, it is actually it's just basic arithmetic.

Jon Wertheim: Are you thinking, ""I bet there are a million people that have also caught onto this?""

Jerry Selbee: Exactly, is what I thought.

When a rolldown was announced, Jerry sprang into action. He bought $3,600 in Winfall tickets and won $6,300. Then he bet $8,000 and nearly doubled it.

The Selbees with correspondent Jon Wertheim

Jerry Selbee: At that point, I told Marge what I was doing. (Laugh)

Jon Wertheim: I was gonna say, you're putting thousands of dollars in action on the state lottery game, at what point do you share this with your wife?

Jerry Selbee: Right at that point

Jon Wertheim: Jerry says, ""I think I've cracked the Michigan State Lottery."" What do you say to that?

Marge Selbee: He just, you know (chuckle) it didn't surprise me.

Jon Wertheim: You weren't surprised?

Marge Selbee: No, I wasn't surprised. Because as long as nobody wins and you win money, you could see the numbers.

Jon Wertheim: So when you realized there aren't a million people that have discovered this, it's pretty much just you, what's that feeling like?

Jerry Selbee: Amazed. (Laugh)

Marge Selbee: Yeah.

Jerry Selbee: Amazed.

Marge Selbee: Pretty happy.

Jerry Selbee: I just couldn't, I just couldn't fathom it.

Soon Jerry and Marge Selbee started playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Jerry set up a corporation, G.S. Investment Strategies. He showed us stacks of record books that detailed their winnings.

Jerry Selbee: Here's one that was pretty successful. We played $515,000 and we got back $853,000

Jon Wertheim: It's about a 60 percent return?

Jerry Selbee: That was a good return. (Laugh)

They invited family and friends to share in their, well, windfall, selling shares in the corporation for $500 apiece. You might say this was a different kind of hedge fund. We met some of the local investors at the evart hangout spot, Sugar Rae's Café.

Jon Wertheim: All four of you guys are members of an exclusive club.

All: Yeah. (laugh)

James White is a local attorney, Dave Huff operated a machine and tool shop and brothers Loren and Ray Gerber are retired farmers.

James White: And when you looked at the mathematics of it, it made sense.

Jon Wertheim: You guys followed the math when he broke it down?

Dave Huff: Pretty much.

Loren Gerber: Yeah, yeah, but he's really good at math

Jon Wertheim: So he explained this?

Loren Gerber: You ask him questions…

James White: Yeah, he's a math whiz

Jon Wertheim: Do you guys remember how much you gave him to invest?

Loren Gerber: I had about $8,000 and then I put another six in for the grandkids.

Jon Wertheim: For the grandkids?

Loren Gerber: Yeah

Jon Wertheim: But overall you guys came out way ahead on this?

All: Oh yeah, oh yeah,

Loren Gerber: It was a good game.

Dave Huff: It helped me put three kids through school and one through law school. So it was quite beneficial to me.

Jon Wertheim: Used it for education?

Dave Huff: Pretty much.

James White: There's a lot of people around town that knew what it was about and talk about it and that it occurred.

Dave Huff: But a lot of people were really leery.

Loren Gerber: You bet!

Dave Huff: They were thinking, ""You guys are nuts.""

Shareholders of the Selbees' company

By the spring of 2005, Jerry's club stood at 25 members. Those willing to press their luck included three state troopers, a factory plant manager, and a bank vice president. They had played Winfall 12 times, winning millions. When Michigan suddenly shut down the game, citing, ironically, lack of sales.

Jon Wertheim: Michigan game gets closed down. How long before you realize there was a game in Massachusetts that also presented some favorable odds?

Jerry Selbee: One of our players emailed me and he said ""Massachusetts has a game called Cash Winfall. Do you think we could play that?""

Jon Wertheim: I've heard that..

Jerry Selbee: And so I got on the computer. I looked at the game and once I researched it, I got back with him and I said, we can play that game.

Jon Wertheim: We got another winner. How long did it take you this time to figure out that you could get a positive return here?

Jerry Selbee: Ten minutes.

That's when Jerry and Marge Selbee developed a routine they continued for the next six years, driving 900 miles to Massachusetts every time there was a rolldown and buying hundreds of thousands of tickets at two local convenience stores. Then they holed up, not in some fancy suite at the high rollers hotel, but in a room at the Red Roof Inn, sorting the tickets by hand for 10 hours a day, 10 days straight, not so much playing the lottery, as working it.

Jon Wertheim: So once there was a rolldown, on average, how much were you putting in play?

Jerry Selbee: Over $600,000 per play. Seven plays a year.

Jon Wertheim: $4.2 million once this rolldown was coming?

Jerry Selbee: Per year.

Jon Wertheim: Did you ever get nervous?

Marge Selbee: Oh yeah. (laugh)

Jon Wertheim: What'd you do with all the losing tickets?

Jerry Selbee: Saved them.

Jon Wertheim: You saved all the losing tickets?

Marge Selbee: Saved them in big totes.

Jerry Selbee: Big plastic totes.

Jon Wertheim: There must have been millions.

Jerry Selbee: 18.

Jon Wertheim: $18 million worth of losing tickets. And you have those?

Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh just in case we had a physical federal audit.

Marge Selbee: We had the upstairs of the barn. I stored them in one end and in the other end. And then I thought, ""Oh no, this floor is gonna fall through."" So then we stored them down in the pole barn. And we had probably 60, 65 tubs of tickets.

Jon Wertheim: Did you guys ever say, ""We're supposed to be retired here. We're making 14-hour drives to Massachusetts.""

Jerry Selbee: We're having fun.

Jon Wertheim: It's fun for you guys?

Marge Selbee: It's fun.

Jerry Selbee: It's fun doing it.

Marge Selbee: You get a high on it

Jerry Selbee: And it gave you the satisfaction of being successful at something that was worthwhile to not only us personally but to our friends and our family.

Scott Allen of the Boston Globe

But in 2011, the Boston Globe got a tip and discovered that in certain Massachussetts locations, Cash Winfall tickets were being sold at an extraordinary volume.

Scott Allen: Smart people had figured out if I buy enough of these tickets, I'll always be a winner. I'll get back more than I spent.

Scott allen oversees the Globe's investigative reporters, known as the Spotlight team. The paper's reporting revealed that two groups were dominating Cash Winfall: the Selbee gang from Evart, Michigan, and their competition, a syndicate led by math majors from MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These were kids young enough to be the Selbees' grandchildren.

Scott Allen: The guy who started it, he was doing an independent study project as an undergraduate at MIT and he figured out that he could win this game. So he got a bunch of his friends to pool in their money so they became, as time went on, professional Cash Winfall players, recruiting their friends and raising money from backers until they too were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Incredibly, the MIT group bet between $17 and $18 million on Cash Winfall over a seven-year period, earning at least $3.5 million in profits. Almost the exact same rate of return as the Selbees.

Jon Wertheim: You've got a syndicate from Northwest Michigan, you've got a group of MIT students. Did your story meter start beeping?

Scott Allen: It was-- oh it's a great story.

The Boston Globe articles caused a sensation, raising suspicion that the game was rigged.

The Massachusetts state treasurer shut down the Cash Winfall game and called for an investigation. It was led by then-state inspector general, Greg Sullivan.

Greg Sullivan: When we got involved, the public perception was there must be some kind of organized crime or public corruption to explain how millions of dollars are being bet by syndicates on state lottery tickets. We really looked at this, looking for corruption. We used subpoenas, we looked at documents, we interviewed dozens of people to look at this in detail with a hypothesis that something illegal had happened.

Greg Sullivan, the Massachusetts state inspector general who investigated the Cash Winfall game

Jon Wertheim: You went into this looking for organized crime. As the story unfolded, were you surprised by what you found?

Greg Sullivan: I wasn't surprised. I was dumbfoundely amazed that these math-nerd geniuses had found a way legally to win a state lottery and make millions from it

Jon Wertheim: And the state's getting rich in the process.

Greg Sullivan: And the state got very rich. The state made $120 million.

The investigation found no one's odds of winning was affected by high-volume betting. When the jackpot hit the rolldown threshold, Cash Winfall became a good bet for everyone, not just the big time bettors like the Selbees. By then though, Massachusetts State Lottery had moved on to a different game without a statistical twist.

And with that, Jerry and Marge Selbee's excellent adventure drew to an end.

In total, their unlikely homegrown company grossed more than $26 million from nine years of playing the lottery.

Jon Wertheim: Your corporation, $26 million. You smile when you recounted that figure.

Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh. That was satisfactory.

Jon Wertheim: Satisfactory?

Jerry Selbee: Yeah.

They made nearly $8 million in profit before taxes. Back in Evart, not exactly the land of extravagance, the Selbees put their winnings to practical use, renovating their home and helping their six kids, 14 grandkids and 10 great-grandchildren pay for their education. They still get together with members of their lottery group. But millions of dollars in Winfall tickets have been replaced by nickel and dime poker night, and Marge makes everyone chicken pot pie.

Jon Wertheim: I'm struck by how measured you are, telling this story. Do you find anything remarkable about this?

Jerry Selbee: The only thing I found really remarkable is nobody else really seemed to grasp it.

Jon Wertheim: What I'm hearing you say is that this part of the country is really good at keeping a secret

Jerry Selbee: (Laugh)

cbsnews,Elijah Cummings' new power as House Oversight Committee chairman,['Steve Kroft'],"Editor's Note: In this story, as originally broadcast, footage of the 2015 Freddie Gray street protests in Philadelphia was mistakenly used. It has been replaced with footage of the Freddie Gray protests in Baltimore.

On Thursday, we learned President Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. It marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the ""Donald Trump Reality Show"" with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave Democrats control of the House of Representatives. Among the recently empowered is Congressman Elijah Cummings, the new chairman of the House oversight committee. It has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the Trump administration and making Cummings one of the most powerful people in Washington.

Elijah Cummings has been a familiar face on Capitol Hill for a long time, a respected 13-term Maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. And he was handpicked by the Democratic leaders for this job.

Congressman Elijah Cummings

Rep. Elijah Cummings: We are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. And you've got to understand that. This is serious business.

You can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of President Trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. And there are 17 other investigations underway. Not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new Democratic House of Representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents.

Steve Kroft: So how are you gonna run this committee?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to work with the Republicans as I have in the past. You know why? Because that's our job. And when it comes to subpoena, I know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. In order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. You gotta have emails. You gotta have information.

For the first two years of the Trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house Democrats. The power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the Republican majority. As ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, Cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like White House security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, and the Justice Department's refusal to defend the Affordable Care Act. All of them were blocked by the Republican chairman.

Steve Kroft: You've asked the White House for a bunch of things. you've asked for documents connected to Jared Kushner's use of private emails. Child separation policy at the border. Have you ever gotten anything?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Zero.

Steve Kroft: Nothing?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. --that's the point. Now, I-- I don't know if any president has ever done this. None. None that has ever said, ""I'm not givin' you anything."" For anything. Nothing.

Steve Kroft: But you're sitting here telling me you think somehow, miraculously, he's going to change.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: it's not about miraculous. It's about-- adherence to the Constitution. And the American people and the Congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. Basically what the president has done and the Republicans have done, they've joined hands. And the Republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. Okay. But no documents? I mean, come on.

Now as chairman of the oversight committee, Cummings no longer has to consult with the Republicans to issue subpoenas, initiate investigations or call hearings, and he has a much bigger budget and staff. So will Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, but their inquiries will be limited to their specific jurisdictions. Cummings' committee has the authority to investigate anything inside or outside the federal government.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: We can look at anything.

Steve Kroft: You could--

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Anything.

Steve Kroft: --look at Interior, you could look at E.P.A.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Anything. but the fact that we can look at anything is part of the problem. There's so much. No, I'm-- I'm serious. There's so much.

Steve Kroft: And you only have two years.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Less than that. Actually, less than that. The Congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. And all I'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying.

Rep. Cummings' father: ""You will fly one day""

Some Democrats believe Cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. He says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. His staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the White House, and the Trump Organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. The issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various Trump enterprises like his hotel in Washington.

Steve Kroft: You think he's making money off this job?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Please.

Steve Kroft: A lotta money?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: A lotta money.

Steve Kroft: And-- and you say the Constitution and the laws say it's not okay?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: It's not okay. And, but this is the other piece. I still believe that people-- the average citizen, the guys on my block, they oughta know if the president is making a deal, whether he's making it-- making it in his self-interest or that of the country.

In response, the White House said: ""these claims are completely baseless, but we cannot comment further about ongoing litigation.""

Elijah Cummings has been in Congress for 23 years but he is not a creature of Washington. When he needs to be there he commutes from his Maryland district, an hour's drive to the north, where he represents 700,000 people and most of the city of Baltimore. He was born here 67 years ago to parents with fourth grade educations who'd been sharecroppers in South Carolina before moving north for a better life. His father worked in a chemical plant, his mother was a domestic. Both were pentecostal ministers.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: First it was religion, and then it was the education. My father, Steve, had a saying. He said-- he told us, ""If you miss one day of school, that meant you died the night before."" And he meant that. I did not miss one second of school between kindergarten and graduating from high school. Not one second.

He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University before earning a law degree at Maryland. He says he is one of the few congressmen who live in an inner-city, working-class neighborhood.

Correspondent Steve Kroft with Cummings at the congressman's home in Baltimore

Steve Kroft: How long have you lived here?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: 37 years.

He says he keeps a campaign poster in the front window so people will know where to find him.

Steve Kroft: So you like to be among your constituents?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go-- I might as well stay home.

When riots broke out in Baltimore three years ago after the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, who was fatally injured in the back of a police van, Cummings gained national attention walking the troubled neighborhoods trying to keep the peace. He is part of the city's fabric.

Rep. Cummings' prayer: ""Guard my mouth""

But now he has stepped onto a much larger stage, under the bright lights of the oversight committee.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Well, I sit here. And the Democrats'll be all over here. And the Republicans will be over there. Our hearings can go anywhere from an hour and a half to 11 or 12 hours.

Steve Kroft: So you got a good, comfortable chair.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Got a good, comfortable chair. And I gotta tell you, Steve-- standing here, it just-- it sorta gives me chills in a way because I think about my journey to this chair.

After years as the committee's ranking minority member, he is ready to wield the gavel and the subpoena.

Steve Kroft: You've got a lotta power. But you don't have unlimited power. I mean--

Rep. Elijah Cummings: No.

Steve Kroft: --and the Republicans are going to put a lot of obstacles in your way.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Sure. I expect that. Now, there's one big elephant that's sittin' around here that we don't know-- what it's gonna yield. And that is Mueller's report. I don't know what that report is gonna have in it. One thing I do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it-- if it exonerates the president, fine. But this I do know: I want whatever it is, for the Congress to have it, and I want the public to have it, so that everybody can make a judgment.

Steve Kroft: Do you think it's possible the Republicans will try and suppress the report?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: I hope not. But that's a possibility. But I hope not. I hope they don't.

Cummings' Republican foil on the committee is Ohio's Jim Jordan, one of the president's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters.

Steve Kroft: You've known Elijah Cummings for a while. How would you describe your relationship?

Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, look, there's-- there's not much of anything that-- that Mr. Cummings and I agree on, policy-wise. But-- I certainly respect his toughness-- his tenacity. You know, he's demonstrated that he's-- he's a fighter and I kinda-- my background is such that I kind of appreciate that.

A founding member of the Freedom Caucus, Congressman Jordan is a one-time college wrestler and coach, still known for his scrappiness. He's seldom seen wearing a jacket, and always ready to go to the mat.

Congressman Jim Jordan

Rep. Jim Jordan: Taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, the economy growing at an unbelievable rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years. 312,000 jobs added last month alone. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the courts. We're out of the Iran deal. The embassy's in Jerusalem. Hostages are home from North Korea.

And oh, by the way, there's a new N.A.F.T.A. agreement. So it's an amazing record and that's what I know about the two years that we've had Donald Trump as President of the United States.

Steve Kroft: After the midterms, you wrote a letter to the Republicans saying, ""You must valiantly defend the president."" Is that your job?

Rep. Jim Jordan: My job is getting to the truth. If the president is getting a raw deal I'm going to defend him.

Steve Kroft: I feel like I would be remiss in this if I didn't point out that truthfulness has not exactly been President Trump's strongest asset.

Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, I mean, Steve, look, this-- this president's probably been attacked more than any president that-- in my lifetime. And here's what I know. Over the last two years, in spite of the unprecedented attacks that have come against President Trump, the last two years have been amazing.

Rep. Cummings' grandmother: ""Don't you wait""

Chairman Cummings wouldn't disagree that the past two years have been amazing, but in a much different way.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: I don't think the other presidents-- called a lie the truth and the truth a lie. I-- I'm gonna tell you, that's what makes the relationship so difficult. It's hard to trust. You-- you wanna believe that if you make an agreement with someone, and I believed that with the other presidents it was this way, their word was their bond. I don't know how to compare. I-- I-- I don't. And I'm not tryin' to be smart.

Steve Kroft: We're in new territory here.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Yes, it's new territory.

The new territory now includes a beefed-up White House counsel's office. It has added more than a dozen new lawyers to fight what it anticipates will be a barrage of requests and subpoenas from congress.

Steve Kroft: What happens if you issue a bunch of subpoenas and the administration doesn't respond? Or invokes executive privilege.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: We probably will end up in the courts. And one of the interesting things about the courts is that our president has been making sure that some of the most conservative judges are being p-- appointed-- to the federal bench. And I think he relies on that, and I think that he assumes that the courts will-- will possibly be, it all depends-- be helpful to him.

It promises to be a demanding time for a man who spent nearly six months in the hospital over the last year and a half for heart and knee surgery. As he showed us the victory prayer chapel, a church founded by his mother, Congressman Cummings relied on a cane and a walker. He says his chairmanship will be a physical burden on him, but his strong faith and awareness of his mortality will see him through.

Steve Kroft: Do you feel like you have the strength--

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Oh yeah, man--

Steve Kroft: --and the stamina to do this?

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Like I tell my-- my constituents, ""Don't get it twisted. You know, I may-- my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. My mission is clear."" And I am prepared and able to do what I have to do. And I will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me God.

cbsnews,Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence,['Scott Pelley'],"Despite what you hear about artificial intelligence, machines still can't think like a human, but in the last few years they have become capable of learning. And suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. Today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. That's why so many people are desperate to meet Kai-Fu Lee, the oracle of AI.

Kai-Fu Lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a Beijing Internet Conference. His 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.

Scott Pelley: I wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence?

Kai-Fu Lee: I think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.

Scott Pelley: But you do believe it's going to change the world?

Kai-Fu Lee: I believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.

Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China. His Beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.

Kai-Fu Lee in a scrum of selfie seekers

Kai-Fu Lee: These are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.

He's funded 140 AI start-ups.

Kai-Fu Lee: We have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.

Scott Pelley: Ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?

Kai-Fu Lee: Yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.

In 2017, China attracted half of all AI capital in the world. One of Lee's investments is Face++, not affiliated with Facebook. Its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. It settled on 61 which was wrong. I wouldn't be 61 for days. On the street, Face++ nailed everything that moved. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called ""deep learning."" Computers used to be given rigid instructions. Now they're programmed to learn on their own.

Kai-Fu Lee: In early days of AI, people try to program the AI with how people think. So, I would write a program to say, ""Measure the size of the eyes and their distance. Measure the size of the nose. Measure the shape of the face. And then, if these things match, then this is Larry and that's John."" But today, you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system, ""Go at it. You figure out what separates Larry from John.""

Let's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? Well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. That's what they mean by deep learning. It's not intelligence so much. It's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.

So, Face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. It's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. When engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again.

Another recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.

Scott Pelley: Now what are all the dots on the screen? The dots over our eyes and our mouths?

Songfan Yang: The computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.

Songfan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students.

Scott Pelley: Well let's look at what we are seeing here now. According to the computer, I'm confused, which is generally the case. But when I laughed I was happy. That's amazing.

Songfan Yang: Exactly.

The machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.

Scott Pelley: It can tell when the child is excited about math?

Kai-Fu Lee: Yes.

Scott Pelley: Or the other child is excited about poetry?

Kai-Fu Lee: Yes.

Scott Pelley: Could these AI systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?

Kai-Fu Lee: That's possible in the future. It can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.

""AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.""

We found Kai-Fu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing studio. He's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. This English teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Duh-Fang.

Many students in Duh-Fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. Most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a boy.

Kai-Fu Lee: When I arrived in Tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me English. And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

And, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm – they too are alumni of America – with a dream for China.

Scott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?

Kai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.

China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.

Scott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.

College student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.

Scott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?

Monica Sun: I never think about it.

Scott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?

Monica Sun: Not that much.

Scott Pelley: Not that much.

With a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China.

Why China is the ""Saudi Arabia"" of data

Scott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?

Kai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.

Scott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.

Kai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.

Scott Pelley: But governments do.

Kai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.

Lee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in a new book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.""

Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.

Scott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?

Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of the jobs in the world.

Scott Pelley: Forty percent of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?

Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.

Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?

Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions.

What data does China have on its citizens?

There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. This system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. So for now, it may be that calling this ""intelligence,"" isn't very smart.

Scott Pelley: When will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?

Kai-Fu Lee: Back when I was a grad student, people said, ""If machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence."" Now we say that's not enough. So, the bar keeps moving higher. I think that's, I guess, more motivation for us to work harder. But if you're talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, I would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.

Scott Pelley: Possibly never? What's so insurmountable?

Kai-Fu Lee: Because I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. And I currently see no way of solving them. Obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.

Scott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?

Kai-Fu Lee: We may.

cbsnews,"Architect goes blind, says he's actually gotten better at his job",['Lesley Stahl'],"At age 45, Chris Downey had pretty much constructed the life he'd always wanted. An architect with a good job at a small housing firm outside San Francisco, he was happily married, with a 10-year-old son. He was an assistant little league coach and avid cyclist. And then, doctors discovered a tumor in his brain. He had surgery, and the tumor was safely gone, but Downey was left completely blind.

What he has done in the 10 years since losing his sight, as a person, and as an architect, can only be described as a different kind of vision.

Chris Downey with correspondent Lesley Stahl

Several mornings a week, as the sun rises over the Oakland estuary in California, an amateur rowing team works the water. It's hard to tell which one of them is blind. And Chris Downey thinks that's just fine.

Chris Downey: It's really exciting to be in a sport where nobody looks in the direction they're going. You face this way in the boat and you're going that way. (LAUGH) So, okay even-steven. (LAUGH)

It's not exactly even-steven in this design meeting, where Downey is collaborating with sighted architects on a new hospital building. But he hasn't let that stop him.

Lesley Stahl: Here you are in a profession that basically requires you to read— read designs and draw designs. You must've thought in your head, ""That is insurmountable?""

Chris Downey: No. I never thought—

Lesley Stahl: You never thought— you never thought the word ""insurmountable?""

Chris Downey: Lots of people— (LAUGH) friends that were architects and anybody else would say, ""Oh my God, it's the worst thing imaginable, to be an architect and to lose your sight. I can't imagine anything worse."" But I quickly came to realize that— the creative process is an intellectual process. It's how you think, so I just needed new tools.

New tools? Downey found a printer that could emboss architectural drawings so that he could read and understand through touch.

Chris Downey: They look like normal prints, normal drawings, on the computer. But then they just come out in tactile form.

Lesley Stahl: So it is like Braille, isn't it?

Chris Downey: Right.

And he came up with a way to ""sketch"" his ideas onto the plans using a simple children's toy — malleable wax sticks that he shapes to show his modifications to others. And he says something surprising started to happen. He could no longer see buildings and spaces, but he began hearing them.

Chris Downey: The sounds, the textures. And the sound changes because there's a canopy overhead.

Lesley Stahl: You can sense that we're under a canopy?

Chris Downey: Yes. It's all a matter of how the sound works from the tip of the cane.

Chris Downey: I was fascinated— walking through buildings that I knew sighted. But I was experiencing them in a different way. I was hearing the architecture, I was feeling the space.

Lesley Stahl: It sounds as if, you began almost enjoying, in a way, being the blind architect.

Chris Downey: It was sort of this— this excitement of, ""I'm a kid again. I'm— I'm relearning so much of architecture."" It wasn't about what I'm missing in architecture, it's what— was about what I had been missing (LAUGH) in architecture.

Chris downey's upbeat attitude doesn't mean that he didn't go through one of the most frightening experiences imaginable — and struggle. He and his wife Rosa were living in this same home with their son Renzo, then 10, when Downey first noticed a problem while playing catch with Renzo. The ball kept coming in and out of sight. The cause turned out to be a tumor near his optic nerve. Surgery to remove it lasted nine and a half hours. He says his surgeon had told him there was a slight risk of total sight loss, but that he'd never had it happen.

Rosa Downey: When he first came out of surgery, he was able to see.

But then things started to go wrong. The next day half his field of vision disappeared. And then —

Chris Downey: The next time I woke up it was— all gone. It was just black.

Lesley Stahl: Complete and total darkness? No light, you can't see—

Chris Downey: No light—

Lesley Stahl: —anything.

Chris Downey: It's dark. It's all dark.

After days of frantic testing, a surgeon told him it was permanent. Irreversible. And sent in a social worker.

Chris Downey: She says, ""Oh, and I see from your chart you're— you're an architect, so we can talk about career alternatives.""

Lesley Stahl: Career alternatives, right away?

Chris Downey: I hadn't been told I was officially blind for 24 hours— and—

Lesley Stahl: And she's saying you can't be an architect anymore—

Chris Downey: Yeah, and she was saying we could talk about career— alternatives. I felt like these walls were being built up around me, just like, ""Yeah, you're gettin' boxed in.""

Chris with his wife, Rosa, and son, Renzo

Alone that night in his room, Downey did some serious thinking. About his son, and about his own father, who had died from complications after surgery when Downey was seven years old.

Chris Downey: I could quickly— appreciate the wonder, the— just the joy of, ""I'm still here.""

Lesley Stahl: It was actually joy?

Chris Downey: Yeah, it was like, ""I'm still here with my family. My son still has his dad.""

Lesley Stahl: You know your eyes are tearing up. You know that.

Chris Downey: Yeah, sorry (laugh). I always have a hard time talking through that.

He knew that how he handled this would send a strong message to Renzo.

Chris Downey: I had been talking with him about the need to really apply himself. At the age of ten, it's that point where if you want something you really have to work at it. And here I am, facing this great challenge.

So, motivated to set an example, he headed back to work only one month later.

Bryan Bashin: This was the most healthy thing about Chris.

Bryan bashin is executive director of the non-profit LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco, and is blind himself.

Bryan Bashin: He waited a few days until the stitches were out of his skull, and 30 days after brain surgery, he was back in the office thinking, ""Okay, there's got to be a way to figure this out. And I'm going to figure it out.""

Bryan Bashin with correspondent Lesley Stahl

Bashin's organization, the LightHouse, helps people new to vision loss learn how to figure things out.

Bryan Bashin: When someone becomes blind, the odds are 99 percent they've never met another blind person.

Lesley Stahl: Is that right?

Bryan Bashin: Yeah, that really is true. Blind people need those role models, how to be blind, how to hold down a job, how to live an independent life.

Specifically, how to work in the kitchen, safely. How to navigate public transportation. How to use screen reading software to listen to emails as quickly as the rest of us read them.

Lesley Stahl: Did you understand that?

Chris: Yes.

Lesley Stahl: No!

And most critically, how to get around in the world alone. Downey learned that at the LightHouse.

Lesley Stahl: When you first crossed a big street like this on your own, was it terrifying?

Chris Downey: Absolutely terrifying.

Lesley Stahl: I can imagine. I can totally imagine.

Chris Downey: I remember that day, stepping off the curb and it was like you would have thought I was stepping into raging waters. Take a deep breath and go for it. You gotta push through it.

Within a few months he was travelling the streets on his own and getting back to normalcy with his son.

Chris Downey: The first Father's Day came up, Rosa was like, ""So, what do you wanna do? Do you wanna go on a picnic, go on a nice lunch? ""I wanna play baseball."" (LAUGHTER) ""with Renzo."" Renzo was like— he pops up. I could just— I could feel him, like, jump to the edge of his chair. ""Baseball, you wanna play baseball?"" (LAUGHTER)

Renzo Downey: So Dad would throw to me. And I'd play like I was playing first base.

Lesley Stahl: How could he throw the ball to you?

Renzo Downey: I'd just call out, ""I'm over here."" And he'd point, and I'd say, ""Yeah, that's right."" And then he'd throw it at me.

Chris Downey: That's something I really loved about our relationship He quickly was looking for possibilities. He wasn't saying, ""You can't do that."" He was like, ""Well, why not?""

Downey seems to have a knack for finding windows when doors slam shut. Just nine months after going blind, the recession hit and he lost his job. But he got word that a nearby firm was designing a rehabilitation center for veterans with sight loss. They were eager to meet a blind architect. What are the chances?

Lesley Stahl: You had to believe that God's hand came down—

Chris Downey: It took my disability and turned it upside down. All of a sudden, it defined unique, unusual value that virtually nobody else had to offer.

Lesley Stahl: Nobody.

Chris Downey: Yeah.

Starting with that job, Downey developed a specialty, making spaces accessible to the blind. He helped design a new eye center at Duke University Hospital, consulted on a job for Microsoft, and signed on to help the visually impaired find their way in San Francisco's new, and now delayed, four-block long Transbay Transit Center, which we visited during construction.

Chris Downey: If you're blind, you don't drive. Right? (CHUCKLE) They don't like it when we drive. So— (LAUGH) you know, we're committed transit users. So the question was, ""How on Earth do you navigate this size of facility, if you're blind?""

His solution: grooves set into the concrete running the entire length of the platform.

Chris Downey: I would just follow this, following those grooves.

With a subtle change from smooth to textured concrete to signal where to turn to get to the escalators.

Chris Downey: Would you like to give it a try?

Lesley Stahl: Okay. I know to go straight 'cause of this line. And I feel— (SCRAPING) Oh my. Oh my. So it's pretty obvious.

Chris Downey: I can hear the difference from here.

It's something sighted people might never notice and that's precisely the point. Downey believes in what's called universal design — that accommodates people with disabilities but is just as appealing to people without them. It's the approach he used for his biggest project yet, consulting on the total renovation of a new, three-story office space for his old training ground, the LightHouse for the Blind.

""I'm absolutely convinced I'm a better architect today than I was sighted.""

Bryan Bashin: Coming into blindness need not be some dreary social service experience, but rather, more like coming into an Apple store — thinking that there might be something fun around the corner.

One of Downey's ideas was to break through and link the three floors with an internal staircase that sighted people can see and the blind can hear.

Bryan Bashin: In blindness, it's so wonderful to be on the 9th floor and hear a burst of laughter up on the 11th floor, or to hear somebody playing the piano on the tenth floor.

For the hallways, Downey chose polished concrete. Because of the acoustics.

Bryan Bashin: I can hear the special tap of somebody's cane or the click of a guide dog's toenails.

Lesley Stahl: The click of a g— (LAUGH)

Bryan Bashin: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: — dog's toenails?

Bryan Bashin: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: Well, is that good or bad?

Bryan Bashin: That's great. It's like your seeing somebody coming down the hall. I know the sound of individual people who work here by the way they use their cane or the kind of walk they have.

Lesley Stahl: You can really distinguish between people by how they tap their cane?

Bryan Bashin: Absolutely.

Lesley Stahl: If you hadn't had Chris working on this building, a blind architect—

Bryan Bashin: It wouldn't have been as rich or so subtle, for sure.

Last spring marked the 10-year anniversary of Downey losing his sight. So what did he do? He threw a party. A fundraiser for the LightHouse — where he's been student, architect, and now, president of the board.

Chris making toast at party: Maybe a slightly bizarre thing, celebrating my 10 year blind birthday (LAUGHTER), but when you're 55 and you have a chance to be 10 again, you take it.

Lesley Stahl: I get the feeling that you actually think you're a better architect today.

Chris Downey: I'm absolutely convinced I'm a better architect today than I was sighted.

Lesley Stahl: If you could see tomorrow, would you still wanna be able to feel the design?

Chris Downey: If I were to get my sight back— it would be— (SIGH) I don't know. I would be afraid that I'd— I'd sorta lose what I've really been working on. I don't really think about having my sight restored. There's— be some logistical liberation to it. But— will it make my life better? I don't— I don't think so.

cbsnews,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The rookie congresswoman challenging the Democratic establishment,['Anderson Cooper'],"The 116th Congress was sworn into office this past week, even as the government remained in a partial shutdown. A record number of women have been elected to the House of Representatives. So far, one newcomer is getting most of the attention, from both the left and from the right. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is 29 years old. She'd never run for elective office before and was working as a waitress and bartender when she launched her campaign. She unseated one of the most powerful Democrats in the House in the primary.

Like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez is a Democratic Socialist. She believes in universal healthcare, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change. She's been described as both an inspiring and idealistic insurgent, and as a naïve and ill-informed newcomer — as the future of the Democratic party, and as a potential obstacle to its success. Few rookie members of Congress have put such bold ideas on the national agenda and stirred up so much controversy before they were sworn in.

Anderson Cooper: There are people that say that you don't understand how the game is played.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Mm-Hmm.

Anderson Cooper: Do you?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I think it's really great for people to keep thinking that. (LAUGHTER)

Anderson Cooper: You want folks to underestimate you?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Absolutely. That's how I won my primary. (LAUGHTER)

Winning that primary shocked the Democratic establishment, and in November, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.

Just a few days later, as soon as she got to Washington, she paid a visit to climate change activists who were occupying her party leader Nancy Pelosi's office. She was the only newly elected member of Congress who decided to drop by during the sit-in, and she called on Pelosi to create a select committee on climate change without any members of Congress who accept money from the fossil fuel industry.

Anderson Cooper: Nancy Pelosi is incredibly powerful.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: She absolutely is. And—

Anderson Cooper: And you're occupying her office.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness, I could have thrown up that morning. (LAUGH) I was so nervous. But— I kept kind of just coming back to the idea that what they're fighting for wasn't wrong. And I— I had also sat down with— with Leader Pelosi beforehand and she told me her story. She came from activism. And I knew that she would absolutely understand how advocacy can change the needle on really important issues.

Is Rep. Ocasio-Cortez afraid of making enemies?

Ocasio-Cortez and her allies managed to get more than 40 members of Congress to support the climate committee.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to create it, but it's not nearly what Ocasio-Cortez had in mind. Pelosi granted the committee limited powers and did not ban members who take money from the fossil fuel industry.

""I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country.""

For Ocasio-Cortez, it was an early lesson in congressional politics. And another one came when she defied Pelosi and voted against the speaker's new House rules, but was not joined by many other progressive Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez told us she's determined to keep fighting for what's being called a ""Green New Deal"" — a highly ambitious, some would say ""unrealistic,"" proposal that would convert the entire U.S. Economy to renewable sources of energy in just 12 years, while guaranteeing every American a job at a fair wage.

Anderson Cooper: You're talking about zero carbon emissions— no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: That is the goal. It's ambitious. And...

Anderson Cooper: How is that possible? Are you talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?

Anderson Cooper: This would require, though, raising taxes.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: There's an element where— yeah. There— people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.

Anderson Cooper: Do you have a specific on the tax rate?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: You know, it— you look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system. Your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to, like, the tippy tops— on your 10 millionth dollar— sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.

Anderson Cooper: What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda — compared to the way politics is done right now.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security.

Anderson Cooper: Do you call yourself a radical?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. You know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.

She doesn't seem to be viewed as a radical by her constituents in ""New York 14"" – the racially diverse, liberal, and reliably Democratic congressional district that includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx. Her parents had met in Puerto Rico. Her father owned a small architectural business. Her mother cleaned houses to help make ends meet. By the time she was ready for preschool, her parents had made a downpayment on a small house in the Westchester suburbs. It was 30 miles and a world away from her extended family still living in the bronx.

Anderson Cooper: What was it that— that brought your parents here?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Schools. Yeah. My—my mom wanted to make sure that I had— a solid chance and a solid education.

Anderson Cooper: Did you feel like you were living in two different worlds? 'Cause you were spending a lot of time in the Bronx with your family—

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah.

Anderson Cooper: —and also here.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. And just growing up that way and with my cousins, who were all my age too, feeling like we all had kind of different opportunities, depending on where we were physically located.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: I am not a ""flamethrower""

She did well in school, and with the help of scholarships, loans and financial aid, attended Boston University. But in her sophomore year, her father died of cancer.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We were really working on the classic American dream. And overnight it was all taken away. My mom was back to cleaning homes and driving school buses to keep a roof over our heads.

She moved back to the Bronx after graduating college and spent the next few years working as a community organizer and advocate for children's literacy. In May of 2017, the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her boyfriend became her makeshift campaign headquarters as she launched a seemingly improbable run for Congress. She was working as a waitress and bartender at the time. Like many members of her generation, she says, she had student loans to pay and no health insurance.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I really understood the frustration that working people had across the political spectrum. When anybody is saying, ""The economy is going great. We are at record levels."" There's a frustration that says, ""Well, the economy's good for who?""

Anderson Cooper: I mean unemployment is at record lows.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I don't think that that tells the whole story. When you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have healthcare. That is not — that is not dignified.

Ocasio-Cortez is sworn in as a U.S. Congresswoman

A group of Bernie Sanders supporters who now call themselves Justice Democrats encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run for office and gave her training and support. She built a grass-roots coalition that took on the Democratic machine by going door to door arguing that she could represent the district better than a ten-term incumbent who spent most of his time in Washington.

Her victory made national news, and she soon had a higher media profile than many veteran lawmakers. Some saw in her primary victory a craving for change within the Democratic Party. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi drew a more limited conclusion:

Nancy Pelosi at press conference: They made a choice in one district, so let's not get yourself carried away

But President Trump rarely missed a chance to suggest that all Democrats were socialists who'd lead the country to ruin.

President Trump at rally in Nevada: Venezuela, Venezuela how does that sound? You like Venezuela?

Anderson Cooper: When people hear the word socialism, they think Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela. Is that what you have in mind?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Of course (LAUGH) not. What we have in mind— and what of my— and my policies most closely re— resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden.

Anderson Cooper: How are you going to pay for all of this?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut. We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, healthcare and education. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force. For all of these— ambitious policies.

Is Ocasio-Cortez pushing her party too far left?

Anderson Cooper: There are Democrats, obviously, who are worried about your affect on the party. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, said about left-leaning Democrats, ""If the next two years is just a race to offer increasingly unrealistic proposals, it'll be difficult for us to make a credible case we should be allowed to govern again.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: What makes it unrealistic?

Anderson Cooper: How to pay for it.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations. And so for me, what's unrealistic is— is what we're living in right now.

Since the election, some conservative media outlets have focused on Ocasio-Cortez with an intensity unusual for a rookie member of Congress.

""The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.""

She's been accused of being dishonest about the true cost of her proposals and the tax burden they would impose on the middle class. She's also been criticized for making factual mistakes.

Anderson Cooper: One of the criticisms of you is that— that your math is fuzzy. The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios—

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness—

Anderson Cooper: —for misstating some statistics about Pentagon spending?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.

Anderson Cooper: But being factually correct is important—

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely important. And whenever I make a mistake. I say, ""Okay, this was clumsy."" and then I restate what my point was. But it's— it's not the same thing as— as the president lying about immigrants. It's not the same thing, at all.

Anderson Cooper: You don't talk about President Trump very much.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No.

Anderson Cooper: Why?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No. Because I think he's a symptom of a problem.

Anderson Cooper: What do you mean?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.

Anderson Cooper: Do you believe President Trump is a racist?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. Yeah. No question.

Anderson Cooper: How can you say that?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: (CHUCKLE) When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's— it's night and day.

In response, the deputy White House press secretary said, ""Cong. Ocasio-Cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that President Trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform…"" and ""... has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms.""

Ocasio-Cortez on her social media battles

One of the few things Ocasio-Cortez has in common with the president is an active and often combative presence on social media. When a conservative writer tweeted this photo of her, saying, ""That jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles,"" she called him out for what she said was ""misogyny.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Would you be taking a creep shot of Steny Hoyer's behind and sharing it around? Why is there more comfort in doing that to me than there is in doing it to— any other member of Congress?

Eliminating the influence of corporate money in politics is another one of Ocasio-Cortez's signature issues. Most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. She did accept some money from labor unions, but she refuses to take any contributions from corporate political action committees. She's angered some of her colleagues in the House by encouraging primary challenges of Democrats who accept corporate money or oppose progressive policies.

Anderson Cooper: These are politically dangerous tactics that you're using...

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah—

Anderson Cooper: You've heard that?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah.

Anderson Cooper: Do you believe it?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely risky. it requires risk to try something new, but also we— we know so much of— of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked, either.

cbsnews,Egypt's President El-Sisi denies ordering massacre in interview his government later tried to block,['Scott Pelley'],"American taxpayers send more foreign aid to Egypt than to any other nation except Israel. But America's nearly one and a half billion dollars a year is going to a regime accused of the worst abuses in Egypt's modern history. Opponents of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi have been imprisoned by the thousands. El-Sisi has strangled freedom of speech. And his troops have murdered protestors. As you might imagine, President El-Sisi does not do a lot of interviews. And we were surprised when he sat down with us. El-Sisi was apparently surprised by our questions because his government has asked us not to broadcast his interview.

Mohamed Soltan in an Egyptian prison

This is an American citizen. In 2015, he was sentenced to life in this Egyptian prison. His crime was transmitting false news, news which offended the man we met recently in New York: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

Scott Pelley: Do you have a good idea of how many political prisoners you're holding?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: We don't have political prisoners nor prisoners of opinion. We are trying to stand against extremists who impose their ideology on the people. Now they are subject to a fair trial. And it may take years, but we have to follow the law.

Scott Pelley: Mr. President, the organization Human Rights Watch says that there're 60,000 political prisoners that you're holding today as we sit here.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: I don't know where they got that figure. I said there are no political prisoners in Egypt. Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology. We have to intervene regardless of their numbers.

President El-Sisi

The ""extremists,"" as he calls them, made up Egypt's largest political party, the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is controversial. Its stated goal is peaceful pursuit of Islamic government. But over its 90 years, members have committed violence. In 2013, El-Sisi outlawed the Brothers as terrorists. But President Trump hasn't designated them a terrorist organization. Nor did President Obama when Andrew Miller was Egypt director in the National Security Council.

Andrew Miller: While individual Muslim brothers clearly have resorted to violence, many have left the party before doing so precisely because they're discontent with the peaceful, gradualist approach of the senior Muslim Brotherhood leadership.

The Brotherhood was one of Egypt's largest education, charity and healthcare associations. Many members are middle class; academics, doctors and lawyers. Modern Egyptian history is a cycle of tension between generals and the Brothers. But this time, critics say, El-Sisi has gone too far.

Andrew Miller: Sisi began by jailing the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists. He extended it to secular opposition groups. And now he's even going after poets and artists and bloggers, people you wouldn't normally think of as political activists or primary public players.

Scott Pelley: Why would he do that?

Andrew Miller: Because he views any opposition to him as a threat to his standing and as a threat to his objective. We have to remember, he is a military officer. He spent his entire career in the military before he became president. And the idea that someone wouldn't obey or listen to his orders is anathema to him.

How Egypt tried to kill a ""60 Minutes"" interview

El-Sisi rose in 2011's Arab spring after Egyptians overthrew a dictator and elected the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammad Morsi. Morsi made El-Sisi Minister of Defense. But Morsi's government was chaotic. He assumed autocratic power. And after a year, there was another uprising. With a good deal of popular support, El-Sisi seized control.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: The Egyptian people rejected such a strict religious government. It is the right of the Egyptian people to choose the form of government they like.

Scott Pelley: They are also the leading political opposition to you. Is that why they have been outlawed?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: No, no, no. We are only dealing with extreme Islamists who are carrying weapons. We would welcome them to live among the people but we don't want them to carry weapons and destroy the Egyptian economy.

Abdul Mawgoud Dardery: General Sisi, unfortunately, kidnapped democracy. He kidnapped our dream of being free.

Abdul Mawgoud Dardery was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood-controlled parliament.

Scott Pelley: But he says he didn't have any choice, he was leading a popular revolution against the Morsi government. That's his argument.

Abdul Mawgoud Dardery: That is not his responsibility as an army general. He was the defense minister. He betrayed his president. He took an oath in front of the president to protect the constitution. The constitution does not give him any right to represent the people. He never did, he never will, represent the people of Egypt.

Scott Pelley: Mr. President, I've spoken to a number of your countrymen who refuse to call you Mr. President because they say you're a military dictator.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: I don't know who you talked to. But 30 million Egyptians took to the streets to reject the ruling regime at the time. It was a must to respond to their will. Secondly, the maintenance of peace after this period required some measures to restore security.

Mohamed Soltan

What El-Sisi calls 'measures to restore security' include the massacre of at least 800 Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Cairo's Rabaa Square. In August 2013, after weeks of protests, Egyptian forces moved in. Among the survivors was Mohamed Soltan, the Egyptian-American imprisoned for reporting false news. Soltan was released 21 months after the Obama administration intervened.

Mohamed Soltan: I was targeted. I was targeted because I had a camera. I had a phone and I was tweeting.

Scott Pelley: Where were you shot?

Mohamed Soltan: I was shot in my left arm. I was rushed to the makeshift hospital where there was blood and bodies, injured bodies, everywhere. Piled upon each other.

The Rabaa Square protest camp was assaulted while El-Sisi was in charge of security.

Scott Pelley: Did you give that order?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: Allow me to ask you a question. Are you closely following the situation in Egypt? From where do you get your information? There were thousands of armed people in the sit–in for more than 40 days. We tried every peaceful means to disperse them.

Scott Pelley: Human Rights Watch issued a report, which you may have seen, describing Rabaa. And it says, and I quote, ""using armored personnel carriers, bulldozers, ground forces and snipers, police and army personnel attacked the protest encampment with hundreds killed by bullets to their heads, necks and chests."" Was that necessary to the peace and stability of Egypt?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: You are calling the Human Rights Watch report a sound statement. Which is not true. There were police personnel and they were trying to open peaceful corridors for the people to go safely to their homes.

Though El-Sisi told us thousands of protestors were armed, at the time, his government said just over a dozen weapons were found.

Scott Pelley: You're a military man. You were educated by the U.S. military. Does that sound like proportional force to you?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: I don't know how come they had 15 or 16 firearms. I would like to tell the American people the situation on the ground could have destroyed the Egyptian state and caused massive instability, more than could be conceived. Whenever there is an armed confrontation with a big number of people, it's difficult to control the situation and to decide who killed whom.

The situation in his prisons is within El-Sisi's control, and there, according to the U.S. State Department, the killing and torture continue.

Mohamed Soltan: In the last six months of my imprisonment, I was in utter isolation. I was systematically, psychologically tortured.

Scott Pelley: What do you mean?

Mohamed Soltan: Light control, spotlight…

Scott Pelley: To keep you from sleeping?

Mohamed Soltan: On me, yes, to keep me from sleeping, 36 hours. Strobe light until I got, I went into a seizure. Guards that were assigned to me right outside my cell would pass razors under the doorstep and the officer doctors would tell me, ""Hey, Mohamed, cut vertically not horizontally so you can end it faster.""

Prison is a tool of politics in Egypt. When El-Sisi ran for re-election last year, he jailed one of his leading opponents and won, his government says, 97 percent of the vote. El-Sisi sees himself as a guardian against the chaos that destroyed Syria, Libya and Yemen. But critics, including Obama national security official Andrew Miller, argue that repression stands to make Egypt more explosive, not less.

Andrew Miller: This is the most repressive government in modern Egyptian history. You have death sentences galore and mass trials. It's, extremely concerning.

Scott Pelley: But Sisi would tell you that he's the reason that Egypt is stable.

Andrew Miller: It's a curious way to describe Egypt to call it stable. Since Sisi took office, living standards have declined. The country is crumbling. The insurgency problem in the Sinai has only gotten worse. It's backed by the Islamic State, entering its sixth year. And you've seen the mass incarceration of peaceful activists alongside hardened jihadists, which threatens to turn more Egyptians to terrorism. That seems to be a recipe for the very instability that Sisi claims he's preventing.

President El-Sisi is fighting terrorism. Last month, a tourist bus was bombed near the great pyramids. The next day, Egyptian forces killed 40 suspects. In 2017, ISIS affiliates murdered Coptic Christians at church and 311 Muslims in a mosque. In our interview, El-Sisi revealed officially for the first time, that his military is cooperating with Israel in the Sinai.

Scott Pelley: Would you say that this is the deepest and closest cooperation that you've ever had with Israel?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: That is correct. The Air Force sometimes needs to cross to the Israeli side. And that's why we have a wide range of coordination with the Israelis.

Scott Pelley: It's been estimated there are about 1,000 terrorists in Sinai. With more than a billion dollars in U.S. military aid every year, why haven't you wiped them out?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: And why hasn't the US eliminated the terrorists in Afghanistan after 17 years and spending a trillion dollars?

President Trump met El-Sisi and King Salman of Saudi Arabia in 2017 to open a Saudi center against extremism. Ironic, after Saudi officers murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the U.S. State Department said El-Sisi is guilty of disappearances and torture.

Scott Pelley: Why should the American people continue to invest in your government?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: They're investing in security and stability in the region. The United States is in charge of security worldwide.

Scott Pelley: Mr. President, your critics, critics in the United States Congress, critics within the United Nations, say that you are holding tens of thousands of political prisoners. That hundreds of people, unarmed people, have been killed in the streets of Cairo. They claim that you have blood on your hands. How do you explain all of this?

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: We are dealing with fundamentalists and extremists which caused damage and killed people over these last years. I can't ask Egyptians to forget their rights or the police and civilians who died.

For now, the White House calculates that fighting terrorism is more urgent than the threat that El-Sisi's repression will ignite another revolt. Egypt's parliament is debating whether to suspend term limits to allow El-Sisi to continue building an Egypt unlike any the modern world has known.

""What I thought was, the reason people were failing is they were trying to overcome nature instead of working with it.""

Marshall Medoff: When I realized what was going on here, I said, 'This is an emergency.' We gotta find new resources. We've gotta find new ways of saving the universe in terms of global warming and so forth and so on.

Lesley Stahl: What was your science education?

Marshall Medoff: Zero.

Lesley Stahl: So, no degree in chemistry?

Marshall Medoff: Oh, of course not. I didn't have any degree in chemistry.

Lesley Stahl: What's your IQ?

Marshall Medoff: I have no idea about IQs.

Medoff has been called a genius, 25 years ago, he became obsessed with the environment and decided to abandon his business career and become an amateur scientist.

Medoff at Walden Pond

But while engineers, geologists and ecologists with Ph.D.s went to labs at MIT and Stanford, Medoff went to one of the country's most legendary settings for reflection.

Marshall Medoff: I used to run out to-- Walden, which wasn't that far away.

Lesley Stahl: You mean Walden Pond?

Marshall Medoff: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: Thoreau?

Marshall Medoff: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: Okay.

Marshall Medoff: What I thought was, the reason people were failing is they were trying to overcome nature instead of working with it.

He knew that there's a lot of energy in plant life. It's in the form of sugar molecules that once accessed can be converted into transportation fuel. The key word is ""access."" This sugar is nearly impossible to extract cheaply and cleanly since it is locked tightly inside the plant's cellulose, the main part of a plant's cellular walls. What's so tantalizing is that sugar-rich cellulose is the most abundant biological material on earth.

Marshall Medoff: Cellulose is everywhere. I mean, there's just so much cellulose in the world and nobody had managed to use any of it. Couldn't get at it.

Lesley Stahl: So that was your target.

Marshall Medoff: That was my target. So, once I decided to do that, I said, ""Wow, if I can break through this, we can increase the resources of the world maybe by a third or more."" Who knows?

To figure out how to break through cellulose to get at the sugars, Marshall Medoff did something that most of us wouldn't dream of: he buried himself away in seclusion for more than 15 years in a garage at a storage facility in the middle of nowhere.

Marshall Medoff: I didn't have a phone there. Nobody could disturb me. And I'd have a pile of papers that I had collected and I started reading them.

Lesley Stahl: The idea that you could solve this big problem--

Marshall Medoff: I know. Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: --no science background.

Marshall Medoff: Yeah. I was-- apparently I must have had a very good mother who-- who, uh, breastfed me an extra few months or something because I had a lot of security about the fact that I'd get it done. And I never had any doubts.

Lesley Stahl: What about your private life?

Marshall Medoff: No, I-- I had to give that up.

Lesley Stahl: You gave up your private life?

Marshall Medoff: Yeah, of course. Because I didn't see anybody from nine in the morning till nine at night or later.

Craig Masterman

Alone in the garage, Medoff started churning out ideas and patenting them. So many, he needed help.

Craig Masterman: Boxes piled to the ceiling?

Lesley Stahl: Boxes? And?

Craig Masterman: Uh, I was shocked.

Lesley Stahl: The way the place looked.

Craig Masterman: Right.

Craig Masterman was Marshall Medoff's first hire 10 years ago. He's an MIT graduate in chemistry.

Craig Masterman: He hired me to build a lab.

Lesley Stahl: So he hired you to help improve what he was thinking in his head?

Craig Masterman: That's correct. But I implement things. He thinks a lot, I implement a lot of things.

A look at the accelerators

What Masterman helped implement was Medoff's novel idea of using these large blue machines called electron accelerators to break apart nature's chokehold on the valuable sugars inside plant life - or biomass. Machines like these are typically used to strengthen materials such as wiring and cable. Medoff's invention was to use the accelerator the opposite way - to break biomass apart.

Lesley Stahl: Maybe you can tell us how the electron accelerator works.

Craig Masterman: It's pretty simple. It's basically accelerated electricity. And so what happens is is that they get accelerated--

Lesley Stahl: Downward.

Craig Masterman: Downward where the biomass is, and they ram into the biomass and rip it apart.

Lesley Stahl: It doesn't sound that extraordinary when you hear it except— no one else had thought about it.

Craig Masterman: I think, I think fantastic stuff is simple in hindsight.

Lesley Stahl: And none of the big scientists who were working round the clock to figure out how to get the sugars out--

Craig Masterman: No, they were all messing with things like sulfuric acid and steam explosion and crazy stuff like that, which is very expensive, all that stuff is expensive. Electron beams are inexpensive.

His inventive use of the accelerators caught the attention of investors who saw a potential goldmine in the technology.They gave Medoff's company – Xyleco - hundreds of millions of dollars, allowing him to scale up and build this factory – in Moses Lake, Washington – so he could turn his invention into reality. It's scheduled to be fully operational this spring.

Here, agricultural residue, like these corn cobs, is trucked in from nearby farms, ground up, blasted by the electron accelerator and then combined with a proprietary enzyme mix.

This process, Medoff's remarkable invention, releases plant sugars that he's now using to make products he claims will solve some of the world's most intractable problems, affecting not just the environment but also our health. One of the plant sugars is called xylose and Medoff says it could reduce obesity and diabetes, since it is consumable, and low in calories.

Craig Masterman: Xylose is called wood sugar And it has an unusual property that your oral bacteria cannot use it. So it won't decay your teeth.

Lesley Stahl: Sugar that doesn't decay your teeth?

Craig Masterman: Yes.

Lesley Stahl: Hallelujah, (laugh) you know?

Marshall Medoff: It's healthier sugar. It doesn't do the same things to you.

Lesley Stahl: So, you could drink all the Coke. You don't have to drink Diet Coke anymore.

Marshall Medoff: No.

Lesley Stahl: And it would taste the same?

Marshall Medoff: Yeah. Of course it tastes the same. It tastes-- tastes like real sugar.

So I tried it myself. ""Trust but verify.""

Lesley Stahl: If I did that I wouldn't die.

Angeles Dios: No, you wouldn't die. It's just sweet. I mean, it's just...

Lesley Stahl: Oh, very sweet. Very sweet.

Marshall Medoff: It's getting a little crowded in here Craig.

With the investor funds, Medoff also opened a $45 million testing facility in Wakefield, Massachusetts, a far cry from the garage. And he hired more than 70 scientists and engineers who have come up with a sugar-based product aimed at another impervious problem, some call it a plague, the accumulation of plastic debris.

Lesley Stahl: You have said that plastic should be outlawed.

Marshall Medoff: Yes, the plastics that are being used should be because all they're doing is accumulating. And there's an enormous amount of ocean that's being despoiled.

Lesley Stahl: But if you take a plastic bag or a plastic bottle of Diet Pepsi or whatever and throw it away, it could be there for 500 years.

Marshall Medoff: More.

Most plastics are made from petroleum. Medoff makes plastic from plants. It seemed to us that his product was hard to distinguish from regular plastic except in one key way. Chemical engineer David Jablonski says that Xyleco's bio-plastic invention can be programmed to disintegrate over specific time spans, ranging from years to as quickly as 11 weeks.

David Jablonski: You can just take this and you can find this is very degraded.

Lesley Stahl: Oh. It's falling apart. So in 11 weeks, it's-- it's already on its way to disintegrating?

David Jablonski: That is correct.

Perhaps Medoff's most consequential discovery is how to extract the plant sugars and convert them into to environmentally-friendly biofuels: ethanol, gasoline and jet fuel.

Lesley Stahl: And I'm told that you call this thing a still.

Marshall Medoff: It is a still.

Lesley Stahl: It is a still?

Marshall Medoff: It's actually making alcohol right now. Alcohol that you can drink, or you can put in your car, or you can do both.

Marshall Medoff: Here we are, on the road again.

Lesley Stahl: So Marshall, I am driving a huge truck on biomass fuel. It doesn't feel any different than normal gas to me.

Marshall Medoff: No. It wouldn't. No.

Medoff's ethanol is much better than regular corn ethanol in terms of greenhouse gas emissions - 77 percent better, according to a study that was independently reviewed.

Marshall Medoff: Yeah, it's a very Einsteinian solution.

Lesley Stahl: Einsteinian, really? Like Einstein?

Marshall Medoff: Yeah, yeah.

Bob Armstrong: I was first a little bit skeptical. It seemed almost too good to be true.

Lesley Stahl: And you had never heard of him, I'm sure of that.

Bob Armstrong: I had not heard of him.

Robert Armstrong, the former head of MIT's chemical engineering department, joined Xyleco's board of directors after Medoff told him about the electron beam accelerator, his inventive way of breaking down biomass.

Bob Armstrong: The electron beam is truly a game changer.

Lesley Stahl: I was told that it's the Holy Grail, getting access to the sugars.

Bob Armstrong: People at MIT are working on it, people in the national labs but nobody's gotten it done yet.

Lesley Stahl: Has Xyleco done it?

Bob Armstrong: Xyleco has done it.

Marshall Medoff: Yeah, he knew I did it, yeah. Of course, MIT couldn't get it done.

He's right about that. He outsmarted MIT and now he's lured some pretty powerful men to his board of directors, including former Shell Oil executive Sir John Jennings, and three former cabinet secretaries – Steve Chu of the Department of Energy, George Shultz, former secretary of state and former defense secretary, William Perry.

Bill Perry: Well, I thought he was another Thomas Edison.

Lesley Stahl: Another Thomas Edison?

Bill Perry: Another Thomas Edison. A genius, A very eccentric genius, but a genius who had come up with this totally revolutionary idea.

Dr. Steven Chu: He definitely is a character. I come from a world of characters (LAUGHTER) in my scientific world.

Lesley Stahl: But he's not a scientist.

Dr. Steven Chu: But he has all the attributes to many successful scientists. You have to believe in yourself. You have to say, ""This is going to work.""

Lesley Stahl: Is there enough biomass to supply enough of this ethanol and gasoline in the world?

Dr. Steven Chu: It can make a significant dent.

A possible 30 percent dent in the petroleum market, according to a report by the Department of Energy. But the question is: can Marshall Medoff scale up his operation enough to compete with the oil industry?

Bill Perry: What is in doubt in my mind is how long it's gonna take breaking into these huge industrial markets, established markets, with established companies. That's gonna be a big undertaking.

John Jennings: It won't turn off oil and gas overnight, obviously. It won't turn off coal. It won't turn off nuclear. It won't turn off all the other sources of energy. But it will find its place. And I think it will find it relatively quickly because of all the boxes that it ticks.

One of those boxes is that Xyleco's fuels could be easily dropped into the pumps at existing gas stations.

Marshall Medoff: You wouldn't have to change anything.

Lesley Stahl: I can just put it right in my car--

Marshall Medoff: Just like we did--

Lesley Stahl: Exactly.

Marshall Medoff: --with the truck.

Lesley Stahl: And-- and also go right up to the pump and get--

Marshall Medoff: Exactly.

Lesley Stahl: It the same way?

Marshall Medoff: Exactly.

Transportation fuels that are clean-green, plastic that disintegrates, sugar that doesn't rot your teeth. It's hard to believe, but it all flowed from the mind of the most unlikely of amateur scientists, who was inspired not by any academic laboratory, but by his owns musings at walden pond.

The killer targeted men he met at after-hours gay clubs and restaurants in San Francisco, and police say he killed at least five men between January 1974 and June 1975. He became known as ""The Doodler"" because he usually sketched them before having sex and stabbing them.

The bodies of four men were found along the beach. Another stabbing victim was found in Golden Gate Park.

Police at the time believed a suspect who assaulted two gay white men at the same apartment complex after the murders in July 1975 was a person of interest in the string of homicides. One victim who survived a stabbing assault said the attacker told him that he was a cartoonist. Police say the attacker was doodling while he and the man talked at a late-night diner. Both assault victims gave similar descriptions of the assailant, and one victim was able to help develop a suspect sketch in 1975.

The age-progressed image released Wednesday was developed from the 1975 sketch, police said. A man was detained in the assaults in 1976, but he was never charged.

Police said they were never able to positively link the assault cases to the five slayings, reports CBS San Francisco. However, in June, police said investigators with the police department's cold case unit were working on a connection.

Police also offered a $100,000 reward Wednesday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer and released audio from a 1974 phone call to police reporting a body found along Ocean Beach. The caller did not give his name. On Wednesday, police asked the caller or anyone who knew who the caller might be to come forward.

Police said the man detained in 1976 remains a person of interest, but wouldn't comment as to whether that person resembles the age-progressed sketch.

An Associated Press story from 1977 quotes police saying they needed testimony from victims in order to charge the suspect. However, three survivors, including a ""well-known entertainer"" and a diplomat, were reluctant to ""come out of the closet"" to testify against him, the AP reported.

AP interviewed gay rights advocate Harvey Milk at the time about the victims' refusal to testify.

""I can understand their position,"" Milk said. ""I respect the pressure society has put on them.""

LONDON — A day before a critical meeting between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the future of their divorce agreement, the European Council president slammed those who encouraged Brexit without a plan on how to carry it out.

“I’ve been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it safely,” Donald Tusk said at a press conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.

Those were strong words from a man who has long expressed his desire to find common ground for an agreement and a close future relationship with Britain.

Since the vote to leave the E.U. in June 2016, leaders of the 28-member bloc have expressed hope that the U.K. will change its mind. Tusk admitted Wednesday that this no longer seemed possible.

“Today, there is no political force and no effective leadership for remain. I say this without satisfaction but you can’t argue with the facts,” he said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to meet with Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Thursday to discuss a way forward on the divorce agreement.

Last month, the deal she negotiated with the E.U. was crushed by members of Parliament, including more than one-third of lawmakers from her own Conservative Party.

One of the main objections to the deal is an insurance policy of sorts known as the Irish backstop. It aims to prevent the reintroduction of a physical border between the Irish Republic, which will remain in the E.U., and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K. and will leave the bloc March 29.

For 30 years, starting in the late 1960s, the border was a frontline in a conflict known as ""The Troubles"" that killed 3,600 people. Some fear Britain's plan to leave the E.U. could result in checkpoints being reintroduced there, which could potentially spur new violence.

European leaders, however, have been clear that the Brexit agreement is not up for renegotiation. Tusk said that he hoped May would come with “a realistic suggestion” on how to end the impasse.

With only 51 days to go until the U.K. leaves the bloc, Tusk said that the E.U.’s most important task now was to prepare for “a possible fiasco” in which Britain departs with no divorce agreement and no arrangements for future trade.

In a ""no-deal"" Brexit, the Bank of England has warned the country's economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year.

Businesses, pharmaceutical companies and supermarkets have already started stockpiling goods. Supermarkets have also warned that fresh produce such as lettuce and tomatoes may be difficult to get in the event a deal isn't reached, as much of their supply in March comes from the E.U.

Should any agreement not win enough support from lawmakers in Parliament, the U.K. could potentially request to delay Brexit — or even decide not to leave.",https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/donald-tusk-says-some-brexiteers-deserve-special-place-hell-n968226,

ISTANBUL — An eight-story building collapsed in Istanbul on Wednesday, killing at least two people, Turkish officials said. Rescue workers pulled six others out of the rubble and were working to free more who were trapped.

The building, which had 43 people living in 14 apartments, had a street-level ground floor and seven higher floors, Istanbul Gov. Ali Yerlikaya said, adding that the top three floors had been built illegally.

It was not immediately clear how many people were trapped in the wreckage.

Former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters at the site that six people were pulled out of the rubble alive and rescuers had made contact with four others still inside the wreckage.

""Racing against time, the teams are working, making great sacrifices,"" said Yildirim, the current parliament speaker who is running for mayor of Istanbul in Turkey's March 31 local elections.

""We will work without interruption until the search and rescue operation is complete,"" Yerlikaya, the governor, told reporters. ""Our prayers are with our brothers and sisters who are inside. Our hope is that we will bring them out safely.""

The chief prosecutor's office said it launched an investigation into the collapse of the 27-year-old building. Yildirim said neighboring buildings had been evacuated in case they were also damaged.

The collapse took place about 4 p.m. on the Asian side of Istanbul in the mostly residential Kartal district. Security camera footage on HaberTurk television showed several people, including schoolchildren with backpacks, running away from the site as the building tumbled down and a cloud of dust engulfed the area.

""We rushed out as soon as we heard a loud noise. When we got out, we saw that the building had collapsed,"" resident Kenan Ayyildiz told the news channel.

Authorities sealed off the area as crowds gathered to watch or help with the rescue operation.

Turkey's broadcasting watchdog later announced the prosecutor's office had ordered a media blackout, citing the investigation into the collapse.

Preliminary testing initially ruled out Ebola, but an evaluation was done out of ""an abundance of caution,"" said Dr. P.J. Brennan, Penn Medicine's chief medical officer.

The hospital did not provide more information about the patient or the circumstances for their treatment, but said that testing is needed when symptoms ""suggest a serious disease, particularly involving patients who have traveled overseas.""

The scare follows another case in Nebraska last month, when an American man was monitored for possible exposure to Ebola following a trip to Africa. He was released after the required 21-day monitoring period when it was determined he didn't have any symptoms.

Ebola is an extremely deadly virus that causes a hemorrhagic fever and has no specific proven cure. It is named after a river in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was first discovered in 1976.

Feb. 5, 2019, 10:56 PM GMT / Updated Feb. 6, 2019, 12:26 PM GMT By Claudio Lavanga and Corky Siemaszko

Pope Francis for the first time publicly acknowledged that nuns have also been the victims of sexual abuse at the hands of predator priests and bishops.

Vowing to do more to protect vulnerable nuns, the pontiff also credited his predecessor, Pope Benedict, with taking action against a French-based order after some of its nuns were subjected to ""sexual slavery.”

“Should we do something more? Yes,"" Francis told reporters during a press conference on the papal flight back to Rome from his historic two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates. ""Is there the will? Yes. But it’s a path that we have already begun.”

""It’s not something that everyone does, but there have been priests and even bishops who have done what you say,” Francis added. “And I think that it’s continuing because it’s not like once you realize it that it stops. It continues. And for some time we’ve been working on it.”

Francis said some clerics have been suspended for abusing nuns. But he said the mistreatment of women is not limited to the church because in many parts of the world, they are still considered “second-class citizens.”

“It’s a cultural problem,"" he said. ""I dare say that humanity hasn’t matured.”

The French order Francis was referring to is The Community of St. Jean, which admitted in 2013 that several nuns had been preyed upon by the Rev. Marie-Dominique Philippe and other priests.

Long an open secret in the Catholic Church, the issue of sexual abuse of nuns was dragged into the open by the #MeToo movement and the reporting of the Associated Press and other news organizations that found cases of nuns being abused in Europe, Africa, South America and Asia.

In November, the International Union of Superiors General, which represents all the world's female Catholic religious orders, publicly denounced the ""culture of silence and secrecy"" that prevented nuns from speaking out. It also urged nuns to report abuse to both the police and their superiors.

Just last week, the women's magazine of the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, pointed blame toward the all-powerful and all-male clergy.

Meanwhile, the magazine, ""Women Church World,"" reported allegations that some nuns who were impregnated by priests were forced to have abortions, which the Roman Catholic church considers a major sin.

Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, whose efforts to bring down pedophile priests were dramatized in the Oscar-winning movie “Spotlight,” said he hopes Francis will ""provide the public with all documents concerning the sexual slavery of nuns and children for the sake of healing and morality.""

""Given the extensive sexual slavery of minor children which has existed in the Catholic church for decades upon decades, it should come as no surprise that nuns are also sex slaves of priests,"" he said in a statement. ""The sexual slavery of nuns and of children are crimes against humanity.""

How big the problem of sexual abuse of nuns is remains unclear.

Victims are reluctant to report abuse because of fears they won’t be believed, the AP reported. And church leaders have been reluctant to admit that some priests and bishops have ignored their vows of celibacy.

Francis suggested that the problem of nun abuse is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

“There are cases, usually in new congregations and in some regions more than others,” he said. “We’re working on it.”

“Pray that this goes forward,” he added. “I want it to go forward.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pope-francis-first-time-acknowledges-sexual-abuse-nuns-priests-n967526,

Authorities said that “every indication” suggested that they had located the relics snatched last summer in a Hollywood-style heist involving a speedboat.

Two 17th-century crowns originally belonging to King Karl IX and Queen Kristina, as well as a royal orb were taken in the July raid on Strängnäs Cathedral, located west of Stockholm.

The stolen items are made of gold, precious stones and pearls and had been locked away in displays with alarms. The theft happened just before noon on a weekday when the cathedral was open to visitors.

The culprits are believed to have escaped using a vast network of nearby lakes.

Swedish police confirmed Tuesday that a security guard had found what they believed to be the stolen crown jewels in the northern suburb of Åkersberga.

“Every indication now suggests that Karl IX's stolen funeral regalia has been found in the Stockholm area, but the police are working intensively to have it confirmed 100 percent,” they said in a statement.

They declined to give further information regarding their efforts to authenticate the items but a spokesman said they are ""most likely"" the missing crown jewels. However, it was unclear if both crowns and the orb were among the items found on the trash can.

One man is already on trial in connection with the theft.

Last year, jewels belonging to Qatar’s royal family were also stolen from an exhibition in Venice. The haul was also believed to be worth several million dollars.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sweden-s-stolen-crown-jewels-have-likely-been-found-police-n966966,

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis on Tuesday said the Vatican is ready to step in and help mediate the escalating crisis in Venezuela — like a marriage counselor.

“I will see what can be done, but the initial condition is that it needs to be both sides that ask for it,” Francis told reporters during a press conference on the papal flight back to Rome from his historic two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates. “And we are open to this. It is the same when both sides go to the curate because there is a problem between husband and wife.”

So far, it appears that only President Nicolás Maduro, whose rule is being challenged by the U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó, has reached out to the pope.

Francis confirmed that he received a letter from Maduro but has not yet read it. He said diplomatic negotiations to defuse the crisis require a series of “small steps” before mediation can begin — and that both sides have to want mediation for it to work.

“Always both sides,” the pope said. “This is the secret.”

Francis spoke as France, Germany, Poland and seven other European Union countries joined the United States, Canada and Australia in recognizing Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state.

Maduro continues to be recognized by Russia and China, the latter of which covets Venezuela’s oil.

The U.S. has long been at odds with Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, the socialist leader who was elected in 1998 and who consolidated power by using the oil boom's revenue to expand social programs for the poor while enriching himself and his cronies.

Chavez died of cancer in 2013 just before oil prices plunged taking the Venezuelan economy down with it.

Maduro was reelected last year in an election that was widely regarded as rigged. And the simmering resentment that followed erupted into a full-blown crisis last month when the Venezuelan National Assembly ruled the election was invalid and declared Guaidó acting president.

President Donald Trump quickly backed Guaidó.

Maduro responded by demanding the U.S. close its embassy in Caracas and ordering all American diplomats out of the country.

Four years have passed since the Islamic State group's fighters were run out of Kobani, a strategic city on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the militants' violent and extreme interpretation of Islam has left some questioning their faith.

A new church is attracting converts. It is the first local Christian place of worship for decades.

“If ISIS represents Islam, I don’t want to be a Muslim anymore,” Farhad Jasim, 23, who attends the Church of the Brethren, told NBC News. “Their God is not my God.”

Religious conversions are rare and taboo in Syria, with those who abandon Islam often ostracized by their families and communities.

“Even under the Syrian regime before the revolution, it was strictly forbidden to change religion from Islam to Christianity or the opposite,” said Omar, 38, who serves as an administrator at the Protestant church. (He asked for his last name not to be revealed for safety reasons. The church's priest declined to be interviewed.)

“Changing your religion under ISIS wasn’t even imaginable. ISIS would kill you immediately,” he added.

While residents are still dealing with the emotional scars left by the brutality of ISIS, Omar says many people in Kobani have been open-minded about Christianity.

“Most of the brothers here converted or come to church as a result of what ISIS did to them and to their families,” he added. “No one is forced to convert. Our weapon is the prayer, the spreading of spirit of love, brotherhood and tolerance.”

Islamic leaders around the world have spoken against the extremists' ideology, accusing the ISIS militants of hijacking their religion.

In 2014, more than 100 Muslim scholars wrote an open letter to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi saying the militant group has “misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/life-under-isis-led-these-muslims-christ-n963281,

LONDON — With every new storm-tossed rescue ship that hauls drowning migrants out of the Mediterranean Sea, European governments are becoming increasingly reluctant to throw open their ports.

The distinction between ""genuine"" refugees and economic migrants is being seized upon as countries, weary of playing the good Samaritan, are now pushing to prevent asylum-seekers from reaching their soil in the first place.

Italy and Malta have closed their harbors to rescue ships and are demanding that other European countries share the responsibility or that migrants are taken to ports in places like Tunisia instead. Migrants must claim asylum in the first European Union country they reach. That means the nations closest to conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa have been forced to cope with the biggest proportion of new arrivals.

Since last summer, Italy has also clamped down on humanitarian operations by detaining rescue vessels on charges ranging from illegally aiding migrants to not being properly registered. That has resulted in fewer boats searching for people in distress — with no rescue vessels sometimes operating in the central Mediterranean Sea.

The language used by some governments to refer to asylum-seekers has also been shifting in recent months.

Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who also serves as interior minister and who is a member of an anti-immigration populist party, has railed against ""fake refugees.""

Sajid Javid, Britain's interior minister, last month questioned whether people attempting to cross the English Channel from France to the U.K. were “genuine” refugees.

“You are coming from France, which is a safe country. In almost every case you are claiming asylum in the U.K. but if you were a real, genuine asylum-seeker then you could have done that in another safe country,” he told reporters.

In recent days, Italy refused to allow migrants to disembark after being picked up in the Mediterranean Sea by the Dutch-flagged Sea-Watch 3 rescue ship. For 10 days, 47 people were forced to wait for a European country to blink first and open its ports.

The standoff ended this week when eight countries — including Italy — agreed to take in the migrants.

However, the breakthrough came only after the Netherlands refused an Italian request to accept the ship. Italy is responsible for handling asylum claims for migrants who reach its territorial waters, but in the past the Netherlands and other countries have taken, on a case-by-case basis, some of those aboard ships refused harbor.

The Netherlands also said there was a need to distinguish between genuine refugees and economic migrants.

“Those who are not entitled to protection must be refused and returned immediately after arriving at the European external border,” Dutch Migration Minister Mark Harbers said in a statement.

But by closing its ports to rescue vessels, Italy creates a conundrum about who will take them in. On each occasion so far, either one state has come forward or the E.U. has cobbled together a coalition of nations prepared to accept them.

But experts say the Netherlands isn't the only European government losing patience with Italy’s refusal to take in migrants rescued from the Mediterranean.

The leaders of other E.U. countries are becoming reluctant to hand Salvini ""a win"" in terms of his populist agenda, according to Luigi Scazzieri, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, a pro-European think tank based in London.

Domestic politics is also playing a role as far-right and anti-immigrant views gain ground across much of the continent.

Nando Sigona, a researcher in migration at the University of Birmingham in England, said the Netherlands' request to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants at the edge of the continent illustrated the hardening attitude toward newcomers across Europe.

“There is more and more emphasis that those who travel to Europe are economic migrants, as if they were real asylum-seekers they would have stayed in the conflict region and claimed asylum” in the first safe country they arrived in, Sigona said.

According to the United Nations, a refugee is someone who is “unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted” and has the right to asylum in another country.

An economic migrant is generally considered to be someone who leaves their country in search of work or a higher standard of living, not to flee persecution.

In a three-year period ending in 2017, 2.66 million people claimed asylum for the first time in the E.U. — with 1.4 million given the status, or around 53 percent.

Michael Collyer, an expert in migration at the University of Sussex in England, said the Netherlands, in deciding to stop accepting migrants who under E.U. law should be dealt with by Italy, was sending Rome a message.

“The European external border is Italy,” Collyer said. “It’s Italy’s responsibility, that it’s nothing to do with the Netherlands.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/europe-grapples-distinction-between-refugees-economic-migrants-n965161,

LYON, France — Weeks after President Donald Trump abruptly announced that the U.S. would withdraw troops from Syria because ""we have defeated ISIS,"" one of the world's top law enforcement officials warns that the terrorist group is still an immediate threat.

ISIS fighters retain the expertise, networks and intention to strike at the United States, Jürgen Stock, the secretary-general of Interpol, told NBC News in an exclusive interview at the organization’s headquarters in France.

""The threat is still very acute, the threat is complex and the threat is more international than ever,” Stock said.

Trump announced the Syria withdrawal on Dec. 19, a decision that has drawn much criticism and pushback from leaders in his own party.

His plan has also caused consternation among many countries participating in the coalition to defeat ISIS, as they fear a U.S. withdrawal would create a power vacuum allowing ISIS to become resurgent and making it more difficult to capture remaining ISIS sympathizers in Syria.

Next week, a draft Pentagon report will warn that without continued pressure, ISIS could regain territory in six to 12 months, two U.S. officials familiar with the draft told NBC News.

Interpol's chief also warned that there were an unknown number of former ISIS fighters now detained in Syria, whose activities and connections need to be investigated as thoroughly as possible before they are potentially released.

US-backed Kurdish forces have previously said that they hold about 2,700 foreign ISIS members and their families.

Among the chief causes of concern for global counterterrorism investigators is the hardened core of fighters of foreign origin who have traveled through areas once controlled by ISIS.

Many of these individuals are “battle-hardened” and possess specific skill sets such as bomb-making that could be used in terror attacks in the future, Stock said.

“Foreign terrorist fighters from more than one hundred countries have been traveling into the conflict zone in Syria and Iraq, so there is a big network now of contacts,” Stock said. “They are in contact with each other, they can share experience, they can talk about attacks that they are going to plan.”

The primary focus for terror attacks remain “soft targets” in areas with unstable security environments, Stock said. “It might be bars, it might be restaurants, it might be hotels as we have seen very recently in Nairobi … places that are favored by the Western community.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/isis-still-acute-threat-u-s-interpol-chief-says-n966021,

They heard about the time he eluded a police raid by scurrying, bare naked, through a tunnel hidden under a bathtub, his mistress trailing behind.

They read text messages he sent to his wife, including one in which he mused that their daughter was so brave he was going to ""give her an AK-47 so she can hang with me.""

And they listened as a former associate described seeing him brutalize two rivals with a stick for hours, shoot each one in the head, and then order his men to toss the bodies into a giant bonfire. ""I don't want any bones to remain,"" he said, according to the witness.

The jurors deciding the fate of notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman sat through 35 days of surreal and often outlandish testimony.

A total of 56 prosecution witnesses were called to the stand, telling stories that at times echoed a Shakespearean drama and at others detailed a Sinaloa cartel bloodbath.

The case is expected to go to the jury on Monday. It will be up to the seven women and five men to decide whether Guzman, 61, is guilty of trafficking more than 440,000 pounds of cocaine, laundering millions of dollars and conspiring to murder a slew of rivals.

The trial, held under unprecedented security at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, delivered on its promise of exposing Guzman's legendary ruthlessness and cunning.

There were tales of cold-blooded murders, lessons on how the cartel waterproofed cocaine packages and cinematic descriptions of how he narrowly escaped police dragnets.

The witnesses' nicknames — Lollipop, The Fat One, The Godfather — were in some cases as colorful as the testimony itself.

One of them, a longtime Guzman bodyguard known as ""Memín,"" described seeing his boss end a man's life in especially gruesome fashion.

The rival cartel member was first tortured for days, the witness said, burned with a clothing iron and left to suffer in a hen house until workers began complaining about the smell.

""He was pretty much decomposing,"" said the former bodyguard, whose real name is Isaias Valde Rios.

Guzman ordered his men to dig a grave. Then the blindfolded captive was brought before the Sinaloa cartel leader, Rios said.

Guzman yelled at the man, grabbed a gun and shot him, Rios said. The victim was still ""gasping for air"" when he was tossed into the hole in the ground and buried under a pile of dirt, Rios said.

The trial took a particularly riveting turn when former Colombian cocaine kingpin Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía walked up to the stand to testify against Guzman. Abadía's face showed the drastic effects of a series of plastic surgeries he'd endured to avoid recognition by rivals or police.

There was also testimony of audacious missions to salvage sunken parcels of cocaine — and multi-million-dollar political payoffs.

In one of the more headline-grabbing days of testimony, Guzman's personal secretary alleged that the boss paid a $100 million bribe to former Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto (Peña Nieto denied it).

Guzman was forced to suffer through the indignity of seeing the text messages he exchanged with his wife — and other messages he traded with his mistress — broadcast to the courtroom.

In 2012, he sent a message to his girlfriend, asking how drug sales were going. ""Oh, like busy bees,"" replied the woman, Agustina Cabanillas Acosta. ""Nonstop, my love.""

Minutes later, prosecutors revealed a text message Acosta sent to a friend, revealing that she knew he was likely spying on her. ""I'm way smarter than him,"" she wrote.

Over its nearly three months, the trial drew a steady pack of reporters and even some celebrity spectators. Near the end of the prosecution's case, Alejandro Edda, the actor who plays Guzman on the Netflix series ""Narcos: Mexico,"" walked into the courtroom.

Edda later told reporters that being so close to Guzman made ""his hands sweaty"" and his ""heart beat fast.""

Guzman's former beauty-queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, added a layer of drama to the proceedings without saying a word. Days after Guzman's mistress took the stand, the cartel leader and his wife showed up to court in matching burgundy velvet blazers, an apparent display of sartorial solidarity.

It took federal prosecutors 11 weeks to present their case. The defense rested after 30 minutes.

In closing arguments, prosecutors told the jury an ""avalanche of evidence"" proved that Guzman lorded over a murderous drug empire. Guzman's defense countered that the government's case was a fantasy concocted by a parade of criminals who ""lie, steal, cheat, deal drugs and kill people"" for a living.

Guzman spoke aloud only once during the trial, when he politely told the judge he was electing not to testify in his own defense.

""Señor judge, me and my attorneys have spoken about this,"" Guzman said, ""and I will reserve.""

KABUL, Afghanistan — A wave of anxiety washed over Mohammad Farooq Niazi as the plane touched down in his homeland.

“I missed my country,” he said, recalling his mindset on the day he returned to Afghanistan after almost three years of trying to build a new life in Europe. “But I wasn’t feeling safe.”

As traffic crawled into Kabul, Niazi worried he'd be killed in one of the regular attacks carried out by militant groups including the Taliban and the Islamic State.

Niazi, 27, is one of thousands of Afghan migrants who have been paid to return home by European governments. Austria gave him $3,100 and a one-way ticket to Kabul. The rest was up to him.

More than 400,000 Afghans lodged asylum claims in Europe for the first time from 2015 through 2017, according to European Union figures.

Hundreds of thousands of other migrants also arrived in E.U. countries during that period, including many fleeing conflicts, rampant corruption and extreme poverty in Africa and the Middle East.

But the number of Afghans returned by European countries to their homeland — either forcefully or voluntarily — nearly tripled, from 3,290 in 2015 to 9,460 the following year, according to Amnesty International.

While some failed asylum-seekers are forcibly removed, others like Niazi opt for the United Nations-operated Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration program, which enables host nations to pay willing returnees to go home. (The U.S. does not fund assisted voluntary returns to any country.)

The amount of money paid by European countries to migrants under the program ranges from around $500 to $4,500 per person, according to Amnesty International.

Advocates of the measure say supporting returning migrants financially helps them to rebuild their lives. They say it also promotes reintegration, as some countries attach conditions to receiving funds such as setting up a business, enrolling in a course or renting an apartment.

But other migration experts and rights groups say the program is not truly voluntary, as often people feel they have no choice but to sign up amid the threat of being forcibly removed. Some also argue it legitimizes returns to countries that are not safe.

Culture shock

The first thing Niazi noticed on disembarking from the plane last spring was the state of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.

“It’s very old and unprofessional in comparison to those of European countries,” he said.

Nearly three years in Europe had changed Niazi.

While he was happy to see his mother again, Niazi said life in Afghanistan initially felt “unfamiliar” and the day-to-day violence weighed on his mind.

He got by on the $3,100 given to him under the U.N. program and went into business with his uncle, who is a butcher.

But after almost a year of being back in Afghanistan, Niazi says he still does not feel safe and says he plans to return to Europe with his mother and his new wife as soon as possible.

Otherwise “our child will be born in a place where there is no peace or stability,” he said. “Afghanistan is not for living or finding jobs.”

'Crime, terrorism, civil unrest'

Many Afghans like Niazi worry about their families’ safety in a country where an emboldened Taliban is fighting U.S.-led NATO forces and the government of President Ashraf Ghani.

The militants were toppled by American forces in 2001 after sheltering 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, but now hold sway over almost half of the country and are again imposing their strict version of Islam on swaths of the population.

By all accounts, security in Afghanistan is deteriorating. The first half of 2018 was the deadliest ever for Afghan civilians, with 1,700 people killed, according to a recent study commissioned by Save the Children.

The State Department also warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan due to “crime, terrorism, civil unrest and armed conflict.”

A recent report by Amnesty International on forced and voluntary returns to the country concluded that returns were taking place despite evidence that people “face a real risk of serious human rights violations.”

Nicola Graviano, who works for the International Organization for Migration, the U.N. body that runs the program, said it continually monitors conditions on the ground as part of the voluntary returns process.

That ""doesn't mean, though, that the situation is rosy everywhere,"" he said. ""It's a constantly evolving situation and we need to be ready to adapt and reconsider our lines.""

He cautioned that the principles of international law — such as not forcing asylum-seekers to return to a place where they face persecution — applied when returning migrants to Afghanistan.

Liza Schuster, an expert in migration policy based at City, University of London, questioned whether the U.N. program should be used to return people to a “country in conflict” like Afghanistan.

“For some people who feel they have absolutely no other choice, they will take assisted voluntary return,” she said. “Even though the voluntary is in heavily inverted quotes.”

According to Schuster, migrants are often told by officials in the West that ""if we have to force you back on a plane you won’t receive anything when you arrive.""

Taking the money as part of the U.N. program can often appear to be a better answer.

Starting over

Saleem Paigeer, 53, has struggled to find work since opting to return from Germany last year.

A father of four, Paigeer now volunteers for a political party, but has no income and is living off the $3,400 he received.

With the money running out fast, he says the family is struggling to make ends meet.

Saleem Paigeer, right, says he doesn't consider his country to be safe. ""If Afghanistan is safe why are there huge walls around the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""What about all the embassies?"" Courtesy Saleem Paigeer

“It is not enough for a family coming back from migration and starting life from zero. A house needs a lot of things,” he said, listing household appliances he could not afford.

Paigeer had lived abroad for 24 years and says his children — his youngest is 8 — are now struggling to settle.

Being a woman in Afghanistan is “very bad,” he said, explaining that his daughters found it difficult to adjust to life with less freedom.

Afghanistan is still one of the worst places on earth to be a girl or a woman, with maternal mortality rates among the highest in the world and domestic violence rife.

In many parts of the country, it is dangerous or culturally unacceptable for girls to go to school and in the worst-affected provinces up to 85 percent of girls do not attend class, according to humanitarian organizations.

A generation gap

Abdul Raziq Raziqian, 50, said that while he was over the moon to be given money to exchange Germany’s gray skies for Afghanistan’s sunny weather, his younger children were desperate to return abroad.

“They miss the playgrounds and the school, they really want to go back,” he said.

Abdul Raziq Raziqian said he knew he was happy to be home the moment he felt the Afghan sun beat down on his brow. “People in Europe pay a few thousand euros every year so they can get sunshine,” he said. ""Now I tell my Afghan friends that we live in heaven, the only thing we have is security problems."" Courtesy Abdul Raziq Raziqian

Raziqian, who has five children, admits that if he had been able to find work in Germany he would have preferred to stay. However, he resents the way the abilities of migrants tended to be dismissed, with asylum-seekers pigeonholed into work “which didn't suit” them.

Raziqian said “uneducated and educated, skilled and unskilled people” — including doctors — were just seen primarily as migrants.

“They wanted to break our honor,” he added.

Now back in Afghanistan, Raziqian said he is also struggling to provide for his family despite owning 20 percent of a spare-parts shop in the western city of Herat.

He said if his younger children win scholarships to study abroad, he and his wife would follow, but otherwise the family doesn’t have the means to try to migrate again.

Political pressure

Despite the security issues, European countries believe Afghanistan still has the ability to take more returnees.

In 2016, the E.U. and the government in Kabul agreed to a pact that aimed to “step up their cooperation” on preventing economic migrants from traveling to Europe as well as returning rejected asylum-seekers to Afghanistan.

As the boats keep coming across the Mediterranean Sea and the political pressure to keep migrants out builds across the continent, the number of asylum claims approved involving Afghans fell from 67 percent in 2015 to 46 percent in 2017, according to E.U. statistics.

But Abdul Ghafoor, who runs the Afghanistan Migrants Advice and Support Organization in Kabul, said in his experience the majority of the younger men who return through the U.N. program eventually attempt to return to the West again.

“The security situation has gone from bad to worse, especially in the last year or so,” he said. “Those who come back voluntarily cannot survive in the country, and so they try to leave for Europe again.”

nbcnews,INF Treaty talks between Russia and the U.S. fail at summit,"['Alexander Smith', 'Alexander Smith Is A London-Based Senior Reporter For Nbc News.']","Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

The United States and Russia announced Thursday that they had failed to reconcile their differences over a Cold War-era nuclear pact, something some experts warn could spark a new arms race in Europe.

The U.S. accuses Russia of violating the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty — or INF Treaty — which was signed in 1987 and bans all land-based missiles with a range of 310 to 3,400 miles.

Moscow denies this and accuses Washington of violating the treaty.

In December, the Trump administration warned Russia that it would walk away from the treaty if it did not comply by Feb. 2 — this Saturday.

Both sides have been meeting in Beijing, but Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Thursday said the talks had failed.

""Unfortunately, there is no progress,"" he told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti according to a translation by Reuters. ""As far as we understand, the next step is coming, the next phase begins, namely the phase of the United States stopping its obligations under the INF, which will evidently happen this coming weekend.""

His U.S. counterpart, Andrea Thompson, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, said Washington will most likely announce the suspension of the INF Treaty in the coming days.

""The Russians still aren't in acknowledgment that they are in violation of the treaty,"" she told Reuters.

However, Thompson did add that ""diplomacy is never done.""

The INF Treaty was designed to keep ground-based nuclear weapons out of Europe. Russia says that the U.S. Aegis missile defense system deployed in Europe could be adapted to fit treaty-violating cruise missiles.

The U.S. has for years accused Russia of violating the treaty with its Novator 9M729 missile.

""These new missiles are hard to detect, they are mobile, they are nuclear capable,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said last week, referring to Russia's 9M729. ""They can reach European cities and they reduce the warning time.""

However, even those experts who agree with the U.S. allegations have cautioned that ripping up the agreement carries significant risks, both for the Trump administration and the security of Europe.

Even a hollow agreement, they say, goes some way to curtailing the development and deployment of weapons that could target European capitals and military targets. Without it, it would be a free-for-all.

""One concern is that in the medium-term there may be the temptation to return intermediate-range missiles, potentially including nuclear weapons, to Europe,"" Karl Dewey, an analyst at Jane's by IHS Markit, told NBC News when President Donald Trump announced his intentions in October.

All this comes at a time when Trump's mixed messages have caused alarm among NATO allies about whether the president would truly commit to the principle of mutual defense if Europe were attacked.

""Accompanying any return of nuclear weapons will be the lingering concerns ... whether the U.S. would be prepared to protect its European allies in a nuclear war in the European theater — i.e. trade Boston for Berlin, Wisconsin for Warsaw,"" Dewey added.

Some backed Trump's ultimatum last year, saying it might bring the Russians to the negotiating table rather than risk an arms race they could not afford.

Others wondered whether the treaty had more to do with the U.S. wanting to keep apace with China, whose weapons are not bound by the INF Treaty.

James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London think tank Chatham House, said that although Russia is violating the agreement, it was a mistake for the U.S. to walk away rather than try to enforce it more effectively.

""Without wishing to pass off any moral equivalence here, both sides are being very stubborn,"" he said. ""Nobody wants to make any concessions, nobody wants to admit they're wrong, nobody wants to seem to give an inch because it looks like weakness or inferiority.""

He believes that the Trump administration should have opted for a middle ground.

""The answer isn't rolling over and letting it happen, and the answer is not walking away,"" Nixey said. ""The answer is: If you don't comply on one aspect of the treaty we will do something about it.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/inf-treaty-talks-between-russia-u-s-fail-summit-n965201,

LONDON — In just two months, Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U.

But inside Parliament, where lawmakers need to agree on and approve exactly how that will happen, it can seem like there are as many opinions as there are days left until Brexit.

Two weeks ago, the divorce agreement Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the E.U. was spectacularly rejected by members of Parliament, including more than one-third of lawmakers from her own Conservative Party.

Since then, in the absence of a new plan being put forward by May, lawmakers’ calls for their own preferred type of Brexit have grown.

On Tuesday night, members of Parliament voted on competing proposals submitted by both pro-Brexit and pro-E.U. legislators. In the end, they demanded May return to Brussels to replace one of the more contentious parts of the agreement, known as the Irish backstop. It is an insurance policy that aims to prevent the reintroduction of a hard border between the Irish Republic, which will remain in the E.U., and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K. and will leave the bloc on March 29.

The E.U. has consistently said the departure deal it struck with May last year is not open to renegotiation.

I asked the relevant EU people what the response will be when @theresa_may asks to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. All replied with just one word. It is “no”. This could be shortest and most hopeless renegotiation in history. — Robert Peston (@Peston) January 29, 2019

And even if May does manage to get concessions on the deal from Brussels, there's no guarantee that British lawmakers would unite around any new proposal.

The impasse has even the most experienced political experts scratching their heads on what's to come.

On Tuesday, lawmakers also approved a proposal calling on the government to stop a potentially disorderly ""no-deal"" scenario. While it is nonbinding, it sent a signal that a majority opposes such a departure.

But unless Parliament agrees to back some sort of plan, that default position is exactly what's in store. In the event of a chaotic ""no-deal"" Brexit, the Bank of England has warned the economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year. It also estimated that the country's GDP could be up to 10.5 percent lower by the end of 2023 than how the economy appeared to be heading before the 2016 referendum.

In the hours before Tuesday's votes, lawmakers eagerly chatted with the press about why their preferred Brexit model would work best.

“I am 100 percent sure in so far as I can tell that the vast majority of my colleagues want to get an agreement with each other and with the E.U.,” Steve Baker, a Conservative member of Parliament, told NBC News.

Baker is a strong supporter of leaving the E.U. no matter what — with or without a deal. He put his support behind a plan to replace the Irish backstop with ""alternative arrangements.""

""I'm not very optimistic.""



Tory MP Dominic Grieve says he thinks the EU has a ""settled position"" on the PM's #Brexit deal and isn't confident @Theresa_May will successfully renegotiate.



Latest on Brexit here: https://t.co/p9x05WAlzo pic.twitter.com/ARcInj5DFJ — Sky News Politics (@SkyNewsPolitics) January 30, 2019

Lawmakers from other parties were just as certain that their way forward would be the one to eventually bring together the divided House of Commons.

“There’s a lot of division and discord in the country and the task for us in the Labour Party is to speak to those 'leave' voters and 'remain' voters and unite the country,” said senior Labour Party lawmaker Andy McDonald.

Despite the divisions both inside Parliament and out, there was a festive atmosphere in the streets as hundreds of protesters on both sides of the debate waved signs, flags and balloons.

“We want out,” shouted supporters of leaving the E.U.

Not far away, a bus campaigning for another referendum drove by, drawing cheers from a group carrying E.U. flags.

With exit day drawing ever-closer, British businesses have sent regular warnings on the consequences of leaving without a deal.

On Monday, seven supermarkets, three fast food chains and the British Retail Consortium trade group begged lawmakers to avoid leaving the E.U. without an agreement.

“We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a 'no-deal' Brexit,” they wrote in a letter to lawmakers.

The absence of an agreement would significantly disrupt goods coming into the U.K., the letter said, pointing out that in March, when Britain is set to leave the E.U., the vast majority of lettuce, tomatoes and soft fruit come from Europe.

Another deeply frustrating day for business. Renegotiation is a throw-of-the-dice, it must succeed or fail fast. Rejecting no deal is welcome but doesn’t get a deal. Until MPs can agree a solution, the threat of no deal will continue to drain money from the UK. — Carolyn Fairbairn (@cbicarolyn) January 29, 2019

Prices for basics could skyrocket, with the cost of beef increasing up to 29 percent, cheese up to 32 percent and tomatoes up to 18 percent, the BRC estimated in a report last year.

E.U. negotiators, meanwhile, have signaled frustration with Britain. The 28-country bloc's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said on Monday that there appeared to be a lack of ""ownership"" in Britain of the agreement struck between the two sides in November.

According to experts, the political deadlock is the result of a perfect storm.

“The divisions are down to the fact that we don’t do referendums very often and the U.K. system was never calibrated to respond to them,"" said Tim Durrant, a senior researcher on Brexit at the nonpartisan Institute for Government think tank. ""In Britain's E.U. referendum, 'leave' could mean all things to all people.”

He added, ""By holding a referendum and then taking the result as divine truth, it has changed how Parliament deals with finding a consensus.”

With the clock ticking, lawmakers are under more pressure than ever to come to some sort of compromise.

For Conservative lawmaker John Baron, the diversity of opinion is all part of the process.

METULA, Israel — A soldier rushes up to a farmer who had just skirted a metal gate to get onto a patch of red earth.

“Move back,” the soldier commands as the hum of a generator fills the air.

“But this is my land,” Haim Hod shoots back. Hod, 71, nicknamed Hamke, stands his ground alongside his wife, Miriam, on what is officially a restricted military area.

Behind the couple, rows of winter-bare apple trees march down toward Metula, Israel’s northernmost town. The soldier is guarding a long white tent that squats before a huge concrete wall. Above the imposing barrier looms a hill speckled with houses — the Lebanese town of Kafr Kela.

Only a few weeks ago Hod’s trees grew on what is now beaten-down earth. On Dec. 4, the couple and the nation were told that an “attack tunnel” had been discovered in Israeli territory that led into Lebanon.

The first of the six tunnels that were eventually found ran under farmland near Metula, which sits among apple, plum and peach orchards that ring with the chirrups of parakeets and the caw-caw of crows.

Officials later warned that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters could have streamed through the tunnels, kidnapping and killing civilians and soldiers.

Some in Metula theorize that the town as a whole would have been captured by Hezbollah — a pro-Palestinian militant group and political party that dominates Lebanese politics and is sponsored by fervently anti-Israel Iran.

Hezbollah fighters are coming home from the war winding down in Syria, where they helped prop-up President Bashar al-Assad as he battled rebels trying to unseat him. Fears are running high that as the battle-hardened militants return to an estimated arsenal of 100,000 rockets and missiles, they will intensify their focus on their original foe: Israel.

Metula, at the tip of a stretch of land jutting north into Lebanon, is especially vulnerable to the frequent flare-ups with enemies across the border. The town was shelled during the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel war, which devastated parts of Lebanon.

In the decade before the 1982 Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, rockets from Palestinian fighters often sent the people of Metula running to shelters.

But not Hod — rockets weren’t going to drive this third-generation farmer from his home.

His stoicism was beyond exasperating when warning sirens sounded and his wife chased the couple’s four children to safety.

After she got the family, minus dad, into a shelter the kids cried over Hod’s absence.

“He is never afraid,” Miriam Hod says over dinner in a hotel the couple run in town. “That is the problem.”

Haim Hod smiles, his white teeth standing out against skin darkened by working in the fields since the age of 9.

“In all the wars, I have never gone to the shelter,” Hod said. “I always sleep in my bed.”

Hod may be brave, but he wept last month when he saw what the army had done to his orchard. The military rolled over his precious apple trees, snapping trunks and branches as they sped toward the newly discovered Hezbollah tunnel. The clearing made, 350 trucks flooded the tunnel with cement.

“The trees are like my children,” he says. “But security comes before children.”

The government will reimburse the Hods for losses incurred during the operation.

The Hods' long tenure in Metula has seen many such trade-offs, the thick stone walls of the 120-year-old family home having been buffeted by waves of war and hardship.

Haim Hod's grandparents were the first couple to be married in the town after Baron Edmond de Rothschild, who encouraged the settlement of Jews in what is now Israel, bought the land from a local Arab family.

Times were often hard and it took the family four decades to repay the French banking scion. Along with other villagers, they periodically had to flee violent flare-ups.

After the state of Israel was created in 1948, poverty drove many of Haim Hod’s 10 uncles and aunts away. Some went abroad, but others stayed and helped “build Israel,” Miriam says.

Now Israel is warning that it may strike Hezbollah because of the tunnels.

“This is not merely an act of aggression. This is an act of war,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said soon after the tunnel’s discovery was announced. “The people of Lebanon have to understand that Hezbollah is putting them in jeopardy and we expect Lebanon to take action.”

Such statements are part of a wider effort to keep Hezbollah and Iran away from Israel's northern border. Israel has only recently admitted carrying out thousands of attacks on Iranian forces in Syria since 2011, abandoning a policy of secrecy that cloaked its military forays.

On Jan. 20, Israel attacked targets near Damascus — killing 21, including at least 12 members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, according to a Syrian war monitoring group.

The strikes were in response to a rocket that Iranian forces fired toward Israel that was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system over crowded Mount Hermon ski resort.

On Monday, the head of Iran’s air force announced: “We’re ready for the decisive war that will bring about Israel’s disappearance from the Earth.”

While Israel’s strikes on Syria are not unusual, drawing attention to them so publicly is, said Daniel Byman, a professor at Georgetown and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Hezbollah regularly engages in attempts to encroach on its enemy, Byman said.

“Sometimes it is missiles, sometimes it is tunnels, and sometimes it is positions in Syria,” he says.

Late on Saturday, Hezbollah's leader responded for the first time to the tunnels' discovery.

In an interview with Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV station, Hassan Nasrallah did not answer directly when asked if the group had built the tunnels, although it is widely believed the group was behind most or all of them possibly as part of a plan to invade parts of northern Israel if the conflict escalated dramatically.

He also told that some of the tunnels were old, and called their late discovery ""a 13-year-old intelligence failure.""

In spite of Hezbollah's saber rattling, most experts agree that it does not want a full-scale war with Israel, which is vastly stronger militarily. But there is always the chance that a miscalculation could spiral into one.

Lt. Col. Avshalom Dadon does not intend to make any such mistakes. In his capacity as an engineering officer in the 91st Division, he helped oversee the discovery of the six tunnels found running into Israel.

“We weren’t surprised that we found tunnels,"" said Dadon, 33. “But we were surprised by their magnitude and infrastructure, and the effort the Hezbollah obviously put into them.”

Each was different, he says — although they were all big enough for a man to stand upright in and were all wired for electricity.

Lt. Col. Avshalom Dadon stands over one of the hundreds of pipes the Israeli military drove into the ground to find tunnels running across the border from Lebanon. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News

Just a few hundred feet behind him, a barrel on a pole painted blue and emblazoned with 'U.N.' marks the boundary with Lebanon.

This is the Blue Line, the border demarcation between the countries. Clearly visible nearby, a cluster of Lebanese soldiers watch. One takes pictures as members of the elite Yahalom engineering unit, faces covered in black balaclavas, drop a tiny camera through a white tube into the tunnel.

“I understand who our neighbors are, and that we’re surrounded by enemies,” Dadon says at a site where a tunnel was pinpointed near the town of Zar’it. “I totally understand that the people we are facing aren’t stupid. They are learning about the IDF every day,"" he said, referring to the Israeli Defense Forces.

Dadon punches a fist into his hand several times to describe the process of carving into the hard Dolomite rock. Hezbollah worked for years to dig through the earth here in northern Israel, often living in the tunnels as they built them, he says.

Soldiers drop a camera down through a pipe into what Israeli officials called an attack tunnel running from the Lebanese village of Ramyeh to near the Israeli town of Zar'it. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News

Dadon likens the operation to locate the tunnels to looking for a needle in a haystack, and says his forces drilled more than 600 holes in the ground to depths of around 60 feet until the six were pinpointed.

He breaks into a soft smile as he describes the excitement he felt at discovering the tunnels after years of searching.

“My wife would kill me to say this, but finding the tunnels — it’s a little like giving birth,” says the father of two.

In Metula, a two-minute walk from the Hods’ hotel, students at the town’s primary school discuss regular emergency drills overseen with military precision by headmistress Marsel Leev.

Noga, 11, explains that these help make her feel safe. And as she grows “older and older,” she is feeling “less and less stress” about the threat they all face.

The girl repeats this breathlessly at least three times, brown eyes widening with emphasis behind dark-rimmed glasses.

Later, Leev walks up a flight of stairs and opens curtains in a classroom to expose a wide panoramic view. The window frames orchards, houses and a road leading out of Metula. Just beyond that snakes the border wall, and then fields, houses and the mountains of Lebanon.

The building, teachers and students are in themselves a symbol of resilience, she says.

“The fact that here you have a school that is 150 meters from the border is a statement to the other side,” Leev says. “We will stay here for generations.”

France is accelerating plans to end its military commitment in Syria and is considering airlifting captured foreign ISIS fighters out of the country, fearing that the precipitous American withdrawal of forces from the battlefield will leave liberated areas unstable and make it impossible to contain the prisoners.

In the wake of President Donald Trump’s sudden announcement in December that he was pulling American forces out of Syria, a senior French official tells NBC News the country is scrambling to adjust its military posture in anticipation of a power vacuum in northeastern Syria as it carries on fighting against the Islamic State. Of critical concern to French military planners is implementing a plan to deal with captured ISIS fighters and get them to get of the country before a U.S. withdrawal.

In an interview with French television BFMTV Tuesday, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said he “couldn’t mention specifics” when asked if France was planning to transfer as many as 130 ISIS fighters to French soil.

Although France’s President Emmanuel Macron lambasted Trump for his decision last month to withdraw from Syria, French officials have been publicly cautious in commenting on how the withdrawal will affect their operations against the former caliphate.

But behind the scenes, they are dismayed and “deeply worried.”

“American troops have made it clear that they are pulling out and that they received no warning in advance,” the French official said. “Since then, we’ve been working around the clock to plan for this American pull-out and how it will affect French military operations in Syria.”

More than 3,200 French military personnel have operated in Syria as part of Operation Chammal, the French campaign against ISIS. French special operations forces work closely with American, British and other allied units in both Syria and Iraq.

The French government announced two weeks ago it is committed to keeping troops in Syria and Iraq for the rest of the year, but the senior official admitted France does not think it can maintain a sustained military presence in the country without U.S. support. The official said France was in “close communication” with Washington about how to proceed.

One of the key concerns for France and other countries are the hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign nationals who flocked to the Islamic State and fought on its behalf. Hundreds of such foreign nationals have been captured on the battlefield by the U.S. and its allies, including France.

What to do with these detainees and returning fighters, or “retournees” as they are known in French, has been a central preoccupation of French counterterror officials.

Of the 22 successful terror attacks in France since 2012, 97 percent were carried out by individuals known to have been radicalized, or otherwise known to police, according to Olivier Guitta, the managing director of GlobalStrat, a risk management firm that studies terrorism. Many of these have been retournees.

“Syrian Democratic Forces are currently holding foreign terrorist fighters, including French nationals, in northeastern Syria,” said Agnès Von Der Mühll, a foreign ministry spokesperson. She would not confirm the number of detainees, however, adding that in light of “American decisions,” the French government was “exploring all options in order to prevent these potentially dangerous individuals from escaping or dispersing.”

The French interior minister said that all of the detainees will be charged upon arrival on French soil. The minister said that each detainee would be charged individually depending on the evidence of crimes they are alleged to have committed — including murder, kidnapping and torture. Previously, prosecutors have successfully convicted some French ISIS members of “association with criminal terrorist activity.”

Although the bulk of the captured fighters are believed to be French nationals, many have yet to be positively identified and have only provided “noms de guerre,” or aliases.

Law enforcement agencies from around the world have been working to share information about captured fighters and terror suspects, often through Interpol, the global law enforcement organization that is headquartered in France.

Interpol has been central to coordinating global efforts to combat terrorism, and now maintains and disseminates a database of 40,000 profiles of “Foreign Terrorist Fighters,” up from just 13 in 2012.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/france-scrambles-move-isis-detainees-out-syria-ahead-u-s-n963916,

WHISTLER, British Columbia — Hassan al Kontar spent seven months watching the planes come and go while stranded at Kuala Lumpur's airport.

No country was willing to accept him, so al Kontar, a onetime marketing manager from Syria, was forced to survive on donated airline meals and sleep on the floor of a terminal.

But sitting on a couch in a cabin house in a bustling skiing community in western Canada, al Kontar said his new reality could not be further away from where he was barely two months ago — thanks to the efforts of complete strangers.

“I was asking for safety, I got it in Canada. I was asking for hope, I got it in Canada. I was asking for freedom, I got it in Canada,” al Kontar told NBC News, his soft voice only interrupted by the cozy crackling from a fireplace. It's a dramatic change from the airport announcement chimes that became the soundtrack to his life in the Malaysian capital.

“I am living the dream,” he added.

Al Kontar, 37, garnered headlines worldwide last year after he started documenting his life through his social media accounts.

In April, a group of Canadians headed by former journalist Laurie Cooper heard about his ordeal and decided to help. They applied to sponsor al Kontar through Canada's immigration system.

But in October, Malaysian authorities arrested him citing security concerns. Al Kontar spent 58 days in a small cell at a detention facility, and feared being deported back to Syria.

“We didn’t know if he was dead or alive,” said Cooper, who had been in regular contact with al Kontar at the airport until his arrest. “He went into a black hole.”

However, his asylum application was expedited by Canadian officials and he was eventually granted refugee status. On Nov. 26, al Kontar was transferred from the detention center back to the airport — this time, with a one-way ticket to Vancouver.

LONDON — At its heart, Brexit is about untangling more than 40 years of shared laws and policy. That’s a tall order for any government, especially given the tight two-year time frame written into the process.

But an issue that was hardly mentioned during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016 has proved trickier to solve than any other: how to handle the border between the Irish Republic, which is in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.

Today, the 310-mile boundary is largely invisible and runs through schools, farmlands, homes and even a church graveyard. It is also the only land border that the U.K. shares with an E.U. country.

And because both the U.K. and the Irish Republic are members of the E.U., goods and people currently flow freely between the two countries without checkpoints or passports being inspected. But what happens when Britain departs from the 28-country bloc on March 29 remains a conundrum.

Prime Minister Theresa May and the E.U. believe the answer is what is known as the Irish backstop. Here's your guide to the proposed measure, which is hated by many Brexit supporters.

Why is the border such a sensitive issue?

For 30 years, starting in the late 1960s, the border was a front line in a conflict known as ""The Troubles"" that killed 3,600 people.

The dispute pitted republicans, primarily Catholics seeking a united Ireland, against British security forces tasked with maintaining U.K. rule over Northern Ireland.

The republicans also fought against local loyalists, primarily Protestants wanting Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom.

A delicate peace pact was negotiated in 1998, known as the Good Friday Agreement. President Bill Clinton helped broker that accord, which allowed the people of Northern Ireland the right to identify and be accepted as British or Irish, or both, within the E.U.

It also resulted in the removal of British military checkpoints and watchtowers. These had been regularly targeted by republicans as symbols of British dominance.

Some fear Britain’s plan to leave the E.U. could result in such checkpoints being reintroduced, reopening old wounds, upsetting the delicate detente and potentially spurring new violence.

What's the current situation?

As members of the E.U., the U.K. and Ireland are both part of what is known as the single market and customs union.

The customs union means E.U. member countries make trade agreements as one bloc. They are not allowed to negotiate such deals with other countries on their own, and they trade freely with one another.

The E.U.’s single market is based around four freedoms of movement: of goods, services, labor and capital.

The U.K. government has said that once it leaves the E.U., it no longer wants to be part of either the customs union or the single market. Post-Brexit, the country wants the freedom to strike trade deals on its own as well as to limit immigration.

What is the Irish backstop?

The U.K. government and the E.U. have both expressed their commitment to avoiding a so-called hard border, with no physical infrastructure or related checks of any kind, between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.

But if Britain leaves the customs union and/or single market before agreeing to a trade deal with the E.U., then a border or some sort of physical infrastructure like cameras or sensors would likely become necessary to monitor crossings.

To get over this, the E.U. included a ""backstop"" in the withdrawal agreement it negotiated with May. It is an insurance policy that guarantees the status quo will remain at the Irish border after Brexit by keeping the U.K. inside “a single E.U.-U.K. customs territory” until a trade deal can be struck. It also keeps Northern Ireland aligned to parts of the single market in terms of some rules and regulations.

The backstop has no end date and would be a permanent feature of their relationship until a trade deal is agreed.

Why do some British politicians object to it?

Many leading advocates of leaving the E.U. are wary about entering into an agreement that ties the U.K. to the bloc indefinitely.

With no end date specified, opponents fear that the U.K. could be permanently giving up the opportunity to negotiate its own free trade deals, a major reason many wanted to leave the bloc in the first place.

The backstop was one of the major reasons why May’s agreement with the E.U. was crushed in Parliament on Jan. 15.

What are May's additional challenges?

The prime minister's ruling Conservatives are a minority government that is propped up by members of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party.

The DUP supports Brexit, but will not back any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the U.K.

Since the backstop specifies that Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the E.U. on some single market rules, including on goods, May's proposed agreement is a no-go for the DUP.

Meanwhile, the E.U. insists that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is nonnegotiable.

Unless there are changes made in Parliament, the U.K. will leave the E.U. — deal or no deal — on March 29.

If Britain does crash out without a deal, then it is unclear what would happen on the Irish border.",https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/what-irish-backstop-why-has-it-complicated-brexit-n961161,

The U.S. government ordered all non-emergency government workers out of Venezuela on Thursday, a day after its long-simmering tensions with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro erupted into a crisis when President Donald Trump recognized the country's opposition leader as interim president.

Embassy security in Caracas has been bolstered, and the U.S. has re-positioned assets in the region and begun the voluntary departure of dependents of American diplomats in Venezuela, according to a senior administration official.

The State Department in recent days has been running contingency plans for potential evacuations from Venezuela and how the U.S. would respond if Maduro were to target protesters or the American embassy, a congressional official said. In the event the U.S. military needed to respond, the U.S. Southern Command could stage out of Colombia, the official said.

Other countries, including Canada, Germany and Haiti, also threw their support to Juan Guaidó, head of the opposition.

How did Trump's Venezuela move come to be?

A couple of months ago, U.S. officials began to look at ways to increase pressure on Maduro, according to the senior Trump administration official.

About a month ago, the Venezuelan opposition began talking to National Security Council officials and those at the embassy in Caracas, the official said. The idea of invoking a particular article in the Venezuelan Constitution that would trigger the ousting of Maduro grew from those discussions, the official said. The official said the Trump administration then began to explore U.S. recognition of the new president once that article was invoked. Security of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton were for it, according to the official.

Members of the opposition told U.S. officials they needed international support to shift the political dynamic in Venezuela, the senior administration official said.

On Tuesday, Pompeo, Bolton, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow met to discuss the options, the official said.

They then met with Trump to discuss recognition, the senior administration official said. After Trump made the decision, Vice President Mike Pence called Guaido Tuesday evening and told him: if on the following day the National Assembly invoked three article that would make him president, Trump would back him.

The policy rollout was surprisingly well-planned, according to a congressional official. The official said the White House started notifying congressional offices around 9 a.m. Wednesday that Guaidó planned to declare himself the acting leader and that the U.S. would be the first country to recognize him.

The White House had its statement prepared, portions of which were read to congressional officials, emphasizing a part about the importance of Western countries following the U.S. in recognition, the congressional official said.

This allowed lawmakers inclined to support the administration's move a chance to prepare statements in advance that were then quickly rolled out in the minutes and hours after Trump’s announcement, the congressional official said.

The senior administration official said the most significant development in the first 24 hours after Trump recognized Guaido was that Venezuela’s military has not made any moves. The official also suggested Maduro may be uncertain about his power over the military because he hadn’t ordered it to squash the protests.

The official said the U.S. believes the rank-and-file military is most likely with the opposition.

The U.S. is still figuring out ways to disconnect Maduro from the country's government money, the senior administration official said.

On oil, one option under consideration is rerouting the money from companies, like PDVSA, to Guaidó, possibly putting it in a holding place. Administration officials have been talking to businesses in Venezuela, namely Chevron and Cisco. Mnuchin and Ross have been calling financial institutions.

On Thursday, the State Department served notice to the Federal Reserve that Guaidó is the agent for access to Venezuelan assets in U.S. banks.

“We're focused on making sure that having supported the constitutional effort of the National Assembly that now we’ll provide the backup for them to succeed,” the senior administration official said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-trump-administration-s-move-venezuela-came-together-n962576,

LONDON — A former leader of Scotland appeared in court on Thursday charged with two attempted rapes.

Ex-First Minister Alex Salmond is also accused of indecent assault.

Salmond told reporters he was ""innocent of any criminality"" as he arrived at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.

""I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I will defend myself to the utmost in court,"" Salmond said, adding that he was unable to discuss the case for legal reasons.

Salmond, 64, served as the country's first minister for seven years until 2014.

He is a member of the ruling Scottish National Party and was a key proponent of Scottish independence from the U.K. in the 2014 referendum campaign. The country eventually voted decisively to stay — with 55 percent backing remain and 45 percent supporting independence.

Last year, Salmond was accused of two instances of inappropriate behavior dating back to 2013 when he was still the leader of the country's devolved government.

The complaints were made in January in the wake of ""wider concerns about harassment"" in British politics, the Scottish government's most senior official, Leslie Evans, said in a statement released last August.

Salmond has denied those accusations made against him as well as any criminal conduct.

Earlier this month, he won a legal case against the Scottish government’s handling of its investigation into the harassment claims. The government admitted acting unlawfully while investigating the claims.

His victory was only to do with the fairness of the inquiry. The police investigation into the allegations is separate.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/scotland-s-ex-first-minister-alex-salmond-reportedly-arrested-charged-n962096,

PUNE, India — Being pregnant, Nikita Vavale finds herself needing to go to the bathroom a lot these days. But what should be only a slight inconvenience is preventing her from leaving the house because public restrooms are hard to find.

Basic sanitation services are severely lacking in India, where 40 percent of the country's more than 1 billion people practice open defecation, according to 2015 World Bank figures. This can result in the spread of deadly diseases, including cholera, diarrhea and typhoid.

Compounded with dirty drinking water, poor sanitation kills around 842,000 people globally each year, according to the World Health Organization. Poor sanitation alone leads to an estimated 280,000 deaths related to diarrhea, according to the organization.

In India, nearly 400 children under the age of 5 die every day because of poor sanitation, according to UNICEF.

Innovations ranging from restrooms on wheels that also boast Wi-Fi access and cafes, to digital sensors in human waste that seek health trends are being tested here in Pune, a city of 4 million in western India that is serving as a real-world laboratory for sanitation systems of the future.

WASHINGTON — With a second U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit looming in February, researchers have discovered a secret ballistic missile base in North Korea — one of as many as 20 undisclosed missile sites in the country, according to the researchers’ new report.

The Kim regime has never disclosed the existence of the Sino-ri Missile Operating Base to the outside world. Ballistic missiles are the primary delivery mechanism for North Korean nuclear warheads.

The report from Beyond Parallel, a project sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a defense think tank, was released Monday and comes after an announcement Friday that President Donald Trump ""looks forward"" to meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un next month ""at a place to be announced at a later date.""

The White House declined to comment on the report.

""The North Koreans are not going to negotiate over things they don’t disclose,"" said Victor Cha, one of the authors of the report. ""It looks like they’re playing a game. They’re still going to have all this operational capability,"" even if they destroy their disclosed nuclear facilities.

Cha says the base is ""clearly a mainstay of their strategic missile force,"" but there are no indications it is part of any discussions on denuclearization.

Situated about 130 miles north of the DMZ, Sino-ri Missile Operating Base houses the headquarters for the Korean People’s Army Strategic Rocket Forces missile brigade, a unit responsible for ballistic missiles. The base has been central to developing ballistic missiles that are capable of reaching South Korea, Japan, and even Guam, according to the report.

Beyond Parallel researchers estimate North Korea has 20 undisclosed sites where it continues to develop its ballistic missile program. Sino-ri is one of the oldest of those sites but is still operational today. Satellite photos dated Dec. 27, 2018, show an entrance to an underground bunker, hardened shelters, and a headquarters area, according to Beyond Parallel. The underground bunkers have rock and dirt berms in front that appear to protect them from artillery fire and airstrikes. The base is just under 7 square miles in size.

Sino-ri is supported by two nearby facilities, the Sobaek-su Academy and Myodu-san training area.

The Sobaek-su Academy was established in the late 1950s or 1960s as an artillery officer’s school and expanded in the following decades, becoming a ballistic missile school early this century, according to the report.

The school not only educates Strategic Rocket Forces officers, but it may also conduct research on ""ballistic missile design and operation,"" the report says. Satellite photos show buildings suspected to hold barracks and classrooms, vehicle storage facilities, and an entrance to an underground facility.

The Myodu-san training area sits less than a mile from the academy and may serve as the training facility for the both the Sino-ri missile base and the academy.

Cha, a former National Security Council official focused on Asian affairs, agreed that the trip to Beijing was a sign Kim is readying for the next meeting.

""This happened last time, too. Kim Jong Un has more leverage in the meeting if he’s just met with Chinese,"" Cha said, adding, ""The Chinese want to make sure that they see Kim before he has another meeting with the U.S. too.""

The Trump administration tapped Cha as ambassador to South Korea, but his nomination was withdrawn in early 2018 because of policy disagreements.

On Sunday, Trump tweeted about a possible second summit, saying he is ""looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at the end of February!"" Trump also wrote, ""The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea.""

The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea. Think of where we were at the end of the Obama Administration compared to now. Great meeting this week with top Reps. Looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at end of February! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2019

But a former senior U.S. official briefed on the current negotiations says administration officials and America's allies in the region are nervous that Trump will give up a lot without getting much, if anything, during the upcoming summit with Kim. Those concerns have escalated since Trump's Syria announcement on troop withdrawal after speaking with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Japanese officials in particular are ""extremely nervous.""

""They’re incredibly uncomfortable,"" the former official said.

They anticipate Trump could agree to international sanctions relief, a liaison office in Pyongyang and an end-of-war declaration, the official said, adding that North Korean officials have told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo they want sanctions relief but the end-of-war declaration is not as much of a priority.

Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well! In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining. If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018

Some Trump administration officials and U.S. allies are nervous because there is still so little known about what Kim and Trump talked about when they met in Singapore last year. Only the interpreter knows, the official said.

""I don’t think the president is telling anyone what he told him,"" the former official said, so the North Koreans can use that to tell American negotiators whatever they want about what Trump said.

Trump said in July via Twitter that the recent lack of North Korean missile launches is a sign that his approach is working.

The Syria announcement has solidified for world leaders, including those in Japan and South Korea, that the only thing that matters in terms of achieving the U.S. position they want is getting a one-on-one with Trump. ""They all know that you’ve got to get to the president and that the president, because he doesn’t study that much, is probably an easy mark,"" the former official said. ""This is a leader game. They’re all trying to get to him. That’s why there’s so much anxiety.""

There is also concern that Trump will fall back on his threats to withdraw troops from the Korean Peninsula. The recent failure to complete the Special Measures Agreement, a regularly renewed five-year defense pact between the U.S. and South Korea, increases the chances of a fight in the alliance, and that precipitates withdrawal, the former official said.

""I can’t find anybody in the U.S. who thinks the North Koreans are denuclearizing,"" the former official said. ""There was a reluctant conclusion that they had to roll the dice on another summit"" to get negotiations moving again.

Jung Pak, a former U.S. intelligence officer who has long tracked North Korea and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said experts both inside and outside the government don’t believe Kim is ready to give up his nuclear arsenal.

Paul Cheung / NBC News

""Credible Korea experts and watchers assess that Kim is highly unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons,"" Pak told NBC News.

The U.S. government assesses that North Korean ballistic missile development and activity has continued throughout 2018 and into 2019, but North Korea’s actions have not been as aggressive as in 2017 when it launched about two-dozen missiles during 16 tests. North Korea’s missile program made dramatic strides in 2017 with numerous ICBM launches and while the launches ceased in 2018, the development did not.

Despite the U.S. desire for the North Koreans to provide a full accounting of their ballistic missile sites and nuclear weapons program, North Korea has not yet done so.

The Trump administration says the discussions with the North have already produced progress by lowering tensions, and that the regime has not conducted new missile or nuclear tests since the diplomacy began.

But former officials and lawmakers say North Korea remains an unpredictable danger to the U.S. and its allies, with an increasingly capable nuclear and missile arsenal.

""Tensions have been reduced. But the North Korean threat has not been reduced,"" Pak said. ""Those are two different things.""

LONDON — Last week, Theresa May’s Brexit plan suffered the largest parliamentary defeat of any British prime minister. Her solution? To press ahead with largely the same plan — albeit with a few tweaks around the edges.

There are 67 days left until the U.K. is due to leave the European Union on March 29, and no agreement among lawmakers on how or even whether the country should leave.

The one certainty at the moment is that if lawmakers fail to agree to a plan, Britain will crash out of the bloc with no agreement on its trading relationship. In the event of a chaotic ""no-deal"" Brexit, the Bank of England has warned the economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year. It also estimated that the country's GDP could be up to 10.5 percent lower by the end of 2023 than how the economy appeared to be heading before the 2016 referendum.

On Monday afternoon, May struck a more inclusive tone when she returned to Parliament to set out her way forward on Brexit. She said that any deal would protect worker's rights and the environment — a key concern of the opposition Labour Party. She also said that the government would waive a fee for the new settled status that E.U. citizens in Britain would need after Brexit.

On the stickiest point of the agreement — a guarantee to keep open the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, a separate country that is part of the E.U. — she said she would hold further consultations to ""find the broadest possible consensus"".

May said that a new motion would be debated and voted on next week.

It’s like last week’s vote never happened. Plan B is Plan A — Sarah Wollaston MP (@sarahwollaston) January 21, 2019

Despite the unprecedented opposition to her plan — her deal was crushed 432 to 202 on Tuesday — some analysts believe May could eventually manage to get it through Parliament.

“The closer we get to the 29th of March, [lawmakers] might swing behind her. It is head-spinningly messy,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London.

After the deal was thrown out last week, May said she would consult with lawmakers from all parties to find a new way forward. That hasn't exactly worked out as planned, and she is also seeking to win over pro-Brexit hardliners within her party — who thought her proposal didn't provide enough of a break from the E.U. — as well as members of the Democratic Unionist Party, a small group of Northern Irish politician which props up the government.

More than one-third of lawmakers from May's Conservative Party voted against her divorce proposal last week.

Meanwhile, other lawmakers are exploring ways to use parliamentary rules to wrestle control of the Brexit process away from May.

“No one here pays attention to procedure until you end up with this crunch and suddenly it matters a lot,” said David Howarth, a professor of law and public policy at the University of Cambridge, and a former member of Parliament.

Even if May wins support in Parliament for her plan B, the E.U. has consistently refused to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.

The E.U.’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated in an interview with Irish news station RTE on Monday that the agreement is the “best deal possible.”

The E.U. is now “waiting for the next step” from the U.K. However, he confirmed that the E.U. would be willing to make changes to the political declaration that accompanied the agreement, though these changes would likely not be legally binding.

May has staunchly stuck to the line that it is her responsibility to see the U.K. out of the E.U. However, support for staying in the E.U. surged to its highest level since the last referendum, and now has a 12 point lead over leaving the bloc, according to a YouGov poll conducted last Wednesday.

In the June 2016 referendum, 52 percent of voters backed leaving the E.U. while 48 percent backed staying.

If the U.K. fails to decide on a course of action, it will face a ""no-deal"" scenario that most experts say would be a nightmare scenario.

Shortages of food and medicine, civil unrest, chaos at ports and airports have all been forecast as possibilities under a ""no-deal"" Brexit.

There are also concerns for what Brexit means for the border between Northern Ireland. The border is currently more or less invisible and there are no checkpoints. Some fear the reinstatement of a physical boundary risks a return to ""The Troubles,"" rekindling tensions that might spill over into violence.

LONDON — Two Australians have become the first international artists to be commissioned to complete a work of public art in Iran's capital, Tehran.

Fintan Magee and Guido Van Helten were invited to mark the 50th anniversary of Australia’s Embassy in Tehran by creating a mural.

The pair spent three weeks traveling around the country, and found inspiration in two men repairing carpets by hand at a bazaar in Kashan, about 120 miles south of Tehran.

“We decided we wanted to do something close to Persian culture, something at least the locals could relate to in some way,” said Magee, 33.

Their resulting six-story tall work is called ""The Carpet Repairmen."" It was jointly commissioned by the Australian Embassy and the Tehran City Council.

""The Persian carpet is in so many households around the world and a lot of people identify with that, so it’s a way to kind of bridge some understanding between that culture and the West using a very obvious symbol,” said Van Helten, 32.

Most Western embassies closed their doors and withdrew their diplomats during the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but Australia's outpost remained operational.

Tehran's murals served as anti-Western propaganda during the revolution while others later paid tribute to those who fought and died in the Iran-Iraq war.

Local artists are now increasingly using vacant walls to try to beautify the city.

“There has been a big movement of contemporary mural art going on, so it was not that unusual that someone was painting a wall there,"" Van Helten said. ""But for them to allow foreign artists to do it was a new thing.""

KOBANE, Syria — American military leaders are ""constantly apologizing"" for President Donald Trump's Syria withdrawal plan, according to the commander who oversees a force of 65,000 U.S.-backed fighters that's battling the Islamic State.

“It was a joint war, but they left us in the middle of the road,” said Gen. Mazlum Kobane, who is in charge of the coalition of militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces.

U.S. troops and Kurdish-led fighters were ""brothers in arms"" as partners on the ground in the war against ISIS in Syria, he added.

But Trump’s announcement that he was withdrawing all U.S. troops from the country immediately has left the Kurds feeling abandoned. The president tweeted on Dec. 19 that the U.S. had “defeated ISIS in Syria,” adding that was the “only reason” to have troops on the ground there.

On Wednesday, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide attack in Manbij that killed 19, including four Americans.

Kobane highlighted that Trump's decision, which was widely seen as the abandonment of a loyal ally, was made against the advice of some U.S. commanders.

“They are embarrassed,” Kobane said, referring to his American counterparts. “They didn’t expect this decision. It’s out of their hands, and they are constantly apologizing for it.”

The general added that 6,500 of his fighters had been killed while taking on ISIS.

Turkey has designated the Syrian Kurds' YPG militia as a terrorist organization and consider it part of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.

The Kurds now fear an attack by NATO member Turkey, which views Kurdish separatism as a paramount security threat.

Administration officials have this month suggested the Syria drawdown will happen more slowly than Trump initially suggested. On Jan. 6, national security adviser John Bolton said that American troops would not depart northeastern Syria until Turkey pledges not to target the Kurdish fighters.

Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019

....Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019

But Kobane said the Kurds still see the pending U.S. pullout as “an insult, a breach of credibility and a broken promise.”

BARNAUL, Russia — The parents of Russian operative Maria Butina have revealed that she became interested in guns as a girl and say they can't believe she knowingly worked on behalf of the Kremlin.

Butina, 30, last month pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an undisclosed agent of Russia in the U.S. She also agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.

The pro-guns rights activist had spent years building connections in American political circles and with influential conservative groups including the National Rifle Association in an effort to push Moscow’s agenda.

But in an interview with NBC News, Butina’s family painted a picture of her childhood in a typical Soviet apartment in Barnaul, a far-flung Siberian city more than 2,000 miles from Moscow.

Butina took an interest in shooting when she was aged around 10, her father Valery Butin said.

“She saw me working with guns and learned about [them] from childhood,” he recalled. “She learned how to shoot, how to assemble and disassemble a gun.”

Butina was an ambitious student who got mostly A's and enjoyed studying English, her family said.

Like many other students in Russia, Butina learned how to assemble and disassemble Kalashnikovs as part of a first aid-related class at school. She was always among the fastest at the exercise, according to her younger sister, Marina.

In addition to shooting, Butina also played volleyball and skied, and enjoyed reading Harry Potter novels and books by Ray Bradbury.

She later attended the local Altai State University where she received degrees in political science and education, her parents said.

In 2011, she founded a Russian pro-gun rights group called the Right to Bear Arms.

“She wanted to influence society,” her sister told NBC News.

“At one point she grew so much that there wasn’t enough space for her in this town anymore,"" Butina's father added. ""And when she had the opportunity to go to the capital, she took it.""

Maria Butina featured in the Right to Bear Arms magazine, September 2014. Courtesy of Butina family

However, one firearms instructor reportedly said that Butina had no idea how to use a weapon around the time she set up Right to Bear Arms.

Speaking to the Associated Press in July, Boris Pashchenko recounted a 2011 encounter with Butina.

""I said [to Maria Butina], 'what about shooting?'"" he recalled. ""Maria said, 'I have never tried it.' I said, 'Come to us. Our acquaintance started with this. She came here, I gave [her] a gun, a rifle, and she tried to shoot.""

It was not immediately clear why Pashchenko and Butina’s relatives gave different accounts of her level of familiarity with guns.

After moving to Moscow, Butina began traveling to America for NRA conventions.

In December 2015, Butina helped orchestrate a trip by NRA members to Moscow in which she set up a meeting between the American gun supporters and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, court papers say.

In 2016, she moved to the U.S. to pursue a master's degree at American University in Washington on a student visa.

The charge against Butina was brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

In pleading guilty, Butina admitted to working with her Republican operative boyfriend Paul Erickson — identified in court papers as as ""U.S. Person 1"" — at the behest of a Russian official in order ""to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over U.S. politics … for the benefit of the Russian Federation.""

Erickson has not been charged.

The Russian fits the description of Alexander Torshin, who recently retired as deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. As NBC News has previously reported, Torshin reached out to the Trump campaign seeking a meeting between Putin and Trump. He met Donald Trump Jr. in May 2016 at an NRA dinner.

The Russian government has strenuously denied that Butina has any ties to official government conduct.

Butina was arrested in July 2018, just hours after President Donald Trump and met Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin privately at a summit in Helsinki, Finland.

The felony Butina pleaded guilty to carries a potential prison term of up to five years. As she's not a U.S. citizen, Butina faces deportation after serving her sentence.

Butina’s father said family members speak with her about once a week from prison, where she awaits sentencing.

Most of his daughter's belongings are already back in Russia, with the most recent batch arriving about a month and half ago, he added.

But Butina's father can't explain how she ended up behind bars in the U.S, saying that he ""can only guess"" that she didn't know ""all the legal nuances.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/maria-butina-wanted-influence-society-sister-says-n959661,

Four Americans were among those killed by an explosion in Syria on Wednesday, officials said.

Two American service members, a U.S. Defense Department civilian employee and a contractor supporting the department were killed while ""conducting a routine patrol,"" according to a spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, and a statement from U.S. Central Command.

Three other U.S. service members were also injured in the explosion in the Syrian city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, Central Command said in a statement. The names of those killed were not immediately released. Defense Department policy is to withhold names until 24 hours after notification of next of kin.

Earlier, a senior Kurdish security official told NBC News that members of the U.S.-led coalition were caught up in a blast at a market in Manbij.

Coalition forces were on foot in the city when they were approached at around 1 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET) by a man wearing civilian clothing with explosives hidden underneath, the Kurdish official added.

The blast happened in a market area of small alleys that is crowded with shops and street vendors.

Two Manbij residents said the explosion took place in front of Kusr al-Umra, a downtown restaurant where U.S. troops routinely eat. Two other witnesses told NBC News that several American troops were inside the eatery at the time of blast, while others waited outside.

U.S. defense officials said the attack occurred while troops were on patrol. They had stopped at a restaurant when a suicide attacker blew himself up.

Saif al-Din Tayyar, a journalist who said he was nearby when the explosion occurred, said he saw around 25 people either dead or wounded. NBC News could not immediately verify his report.

Witnesses told NBC News that military helicopters were sent to the scene to help deal with the casualties.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack through recognized social media accounts, claiming a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest attacked coalition forces. ISIS did not immediately produce evidence to support the claim.

American defense officials said that despite the claim of responsibility by the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, there has been little to no ISIS presence in Manbij in months, and the terror group sometimes falsely claims responsibility for attacks.

Wednesday’s killing of two U.S. service members was the single deadliest day for American forces in Syria.

Between 2014 and 2018, four service members died in the country, including two in combat, according to the Defense Department. Each of the four deaths occurred on different days.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that President Donald Trump had been ""fully briefed and we will continue to monitor the ongoing situation in Syria.""

""Our deepest sympathies and love go out to the families of the brave American heroes who were killed today in Syria,"" a statement from the White House press secretary said. ""We also pray for the soldiers who were wounded in the attack. Our service members and their families have all sacrificed so much for our country.""

Just hours after the attack, Vice President Mike Pence touted the administration’s success defeating ISIS. ""The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated,"" Pence told diplomats at the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference in Washington D.C.

He added immediately afterwards that the U.S. would ""stay in the region and we’ll stay in the fight to ensure that ISIS does not rear its ugly head again,” but did not specify where or what that would entail.

The attack comes weeks after Trump announced that he was withdrawing all U.S. troops from Syria immediately.

On Dec. 19, he tweeted that the U.S. had “defeated ISIS in Syria,” adding that was the “only reason” to have troops on the ground there.

""We have won against ISIS. We have beaten them and we have beaten them badly,"" he said in a video posted on his Twitter account.

Administration officials later said the drawdown will happen more slowly.

National security adviser John Bolton said on Jan. 6 that American troops will not leave northeastern Syria until ISIS is defeated and American-allied Kurdish fighters are protected.

Turkey has threatened to attack the Kurds, who have been America's partners on the ground in the war against ISIS in Syria. Turkey views the Syrian Kurds, or YPG Kurdish militia, as a terrorist organization and part of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.

However, a U.S. military official on Friday confirmed that the U.S.-led military coalition had begun the process of withdrawing troops from Syria.

IN NORTHERN SYRIA — A Texan who says he offered to work as an English teacher for the Islamic State and was captured earlier this month in Syria by U.S.-backed forces said he witnessed executions and crucifixions during the more than three years he spent with the terrorist group.

But 34-year-old Warren Christopher Clark, who is being held in Kurdish custody, told NBC News in an exclusive interview that he does not regret throwing in his lot with ISIS. No Kurdish security were present during the interview.

“I wanted to go see exactly what the group was about, and what they were doing,” he said. “Of course I saw the videos. I think with the beheadings, that’s execution. I’m from the United States, from Texas. They like to execute people, too. So I really don’t see any difference. They might do it off camera, but it’s the same.”

A Muslim convert, Clark was being held in northern Syria after being captured during the campaign to liberate the last pockets occupied by ISIS in Syria, the coalition of militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces said. (For security reasons, NBC News is not identifying the town where Clark was interviewed.)

Clark, a former substitute teacher from Sugar Land, Texas, said the FBI has been in contact with him but he does not know what will happen to him next. He said he never fought for ISIS and said he was detained nearly a dozen times for refusing to take up arms.

Each time, Clark said, ISIS let him go and he suffered no abuse at their hands. But he admitted offering to work for them as an English teacher.

NBC News reported last year that Clark's résumé was found at a house in Iraq and was later obtained by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. In a cover letter, Clark said he was hoping to obtain a job teaching English to students in territory seized by ISIS.

""I was born and raised in the United States and have always loved teaching others and learning from others as well. My work background is largely in English and I consider working at the University of Mosul to be a great way of continuing my career,"" read the cover letter, which used the alias Abu Muhammad al-Ameriki.

The résumé included an email address, education credentials and work experience, and the researchers were able to determine that Abu Muhammad al-Ameriki was Clark, who graduated from the University of Houston.

""I was in living in Mosul at the time, and I needed a way to support myself,"" Clark said.

Clark says he was drawn to ISIS out of curiosity.

""I wanted to learn more about the ideology. I'm a political science major, global business minor. I like politics. I like travel, world events. That's what I wanted to do,"" he said.

But while Clark claims he was able to avoid fighting on the front lines, the war was never far away.

""It was a place that was constantly being bombed,"" he said. ""You were always on edge. Day and night, just bombs and airstrikes. You sleep in the middle of the day. I spent most of my time living in a mosque. I just remember every day hoping not to get bombed.""

Clark said he crossed into Syria from Turkey in June 2015.

The Texan was detained around the same time as two foreign militants from Pakistan, a fourth from Dublin, Ireland, and fifth man from Trinidad and Tobago, according to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

The State Department said it was aware of ""these open source reports"" but gave no further comment.

Shiraz Maher, deputy director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King's College London, said there were conflicting reports on how many foreign fighters remained in Syria.

""Some have been captured, some have been killed and some are still alive and operational,"" he said.

Last year, a report by the Program on Extremism found that 64 Americans had traveled to Iraq and Syria in support of the Islamic State since 2011. This compares to the thousands of Europeans who joined ISIS during the same period.

British lawmakers are set to vote Tuesday on whether to approve Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal that would take the country out of the European Union.

Whatever the outcome, the world's fifth-largest economy is set to take a massive hit — and so could the U.S.

Brexit has already proven its potential to upset other economies. ""With the original referendum with respect to Brexit … if you look at the Dow, there was a tremendous drop post the vote,"" said Tifphani White-King at Mazars USA.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 608 points, or almost 3.4 percent, the day after the vote — and the pain didn't stop there. Global markets lost $2 trillion in value. The U.S. dollar increased in value, and ""that's not always a good thing,"" White-King said. A higher dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive for buyers in other countries. It also means stocks and U.S. investments are more expensive for international buyers.

""As we get closer to [Brexit date] March 29, the amount of uncertainty is going to increase,"" said Peter Earle, economist and research fellow at The American Institute for Economic Research. ""That's going to affect the markets.""

Not only could stocks take a hit, but so might bond yields ""as investors and different entities in other markets jump into government bonds for safety,"" he added. And that would mean investment and retirement accounts for regular Americans.

There's a more direct impact on U.S. businesses: ""Many American businesses use the U.K. as their doorway to the E.U.,"" Earle told NBC News. ""With a hard Brexit, that's going to cause a lot of complications for U.S. businesses."" Companies will find it harder and more expensive to move goods between the U.K. and rest of Europe, with delays, tariffs, and more paperwork.

Even travel for salespeople, technical personnel, and executives will be more difficult. What used to be a quick trip from the U.K. to the continent or back now would require more time clearing customs and less assurance of easy movement.

While none of this is directly apparent to U.S. consumers, ""It eventually works its way into the consumer level,"" said Johan Gott, a principal at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

The biggest problem for businesses may be that they aren't preparing sufficiently. According to Gott, ""by and large, the U.S. focus in the business community has been very much on China, on steel tariffs, and to a certain degree the possibility of U.S. auto tariffs, which could be very disruptive.""

""Businesses can deal with almost anything if they have warning and things are gradual,"" Gott said. ""Right now, we're seeing a two-month window and no idea of what will happen."" And no idea how bad things might get with the lack of preparation.",https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/u-s-won-t-escape-pain-brexit-n958361,

The two-year-old boy, whose first name is Yulen, fell down the hole on Sunday.

More than 100 rescuers including firefighters, police officers and underwater teams were at the site in Totalán, a town in the southern province of Málaga. A specialist mine rescue team was en route to the scene on Tuesday afternoon.

The well is 360 feet deep and only about 10 inches wide, according to Bernardo Moltó, a spokesman for the Málaga Civil Guard.

On Monday, crews sent a robotic camera into the well. It made it 229 feet below the surface, where it found some candies the boy had been carrying. However, the width of the passage prevented the device from going any further.

Rescue workers were attempting to widen the passage to allow the camera to go deeper, Pilar Limon, a spokesperson for the Emergencies Coordination Unit, told NBC News.

Teams were concentrating their efforts on securing an alternative rescue route by digging a tunnel that would intersect the well, according to Maria Galvez, a Málaga government official at the site.

RAMSGATE, England — Stuart Piper is enthusiastically awaiting Britain’s looming departure from the European Union.

He is not alone in this corner of England. Nearly 64 percent of people in Thanet, the administrative district that includes the once-thriving port town of Ramsgate, supported leaving in the 2016 referendum.

Since then, both the government and experts have predicted that Brexit will result in the U.K. being worse off.

The Bank of England has warned that a ""disorderly"" scenario — involving severe delays at U.K. borders and financial markets' loss of confidence in British institutions — could shrink the British economy as much as 8 percent in about a year, with the value of the pound tumbling 25 percent, and house prices falling by 30 percent.

Food and medicine shortages are also possibilities if U.K. ports end up gridlocked due to customs checks being introduced, and the government has said 3,500 troops will be on standby to help deal with disruptions or civil unrest.

Britain will leave the 28-country bloc on March 29 — but with only 74 days to go, lawmakers are bitterly divided about the proposed divorce agreement, meaning a ""no-deal"" Brexit without any arrangement for future trade is the default option.

The country's finance minister last year also warned that a split without a pact would cost Britain tens of billions of dollars — more than it currently contributes to the E.U.

However, the ""no-deal"" option would “please” or “delight” around 15 percent of people, according to recent YouGov polls.

Many who support Brexit are anxious for the government to get on with it, no matter the cost.

“There is little doubt that this multicultural experiment has failed miserably,” said Piper, a local politician and former Baptist minister.

Proponents of the U.K.’s departure feel that the E.U. has held Britain back from economic success and that its freedom of movement laws have allowed too many low-skilled migrants into the country.

Around 700 migrants moved to Thanet in 2017, according to local government figures. The district is home to around 140,000 people.

Piper, like many others who support Brexit, isn’t against Europe as a trade partner. His son recently migrated to Poland, and Piper lived for many years in Germany while serving in the army.

He called the predictions of a poorer future outside the E.U. “laughable,” claiming such warnings are nothing more than ""project fear"" — or scaremongering by elites.

“Leaving the E.U. won’t make life here better, but it won’t make it worse,” said Neil Hopkins, as he fixed a tablet computer at his shop, the IT Service Centre, in Ramsgate.

With cuts to public services and a lack of hospital spaces, he felt Britain “couldn’t carry on importing E.U. nationals. No deal is fine.”

Since late last year, hundreds of migrants have also left France and made the 21-mile journey across the English Channel — one of the world's busiest shipping lanes — in flimsy dinghies and other small vessels. They've landed in Kent, the county where Ramsgate is.

Ramsgate is in some ways similar to the U.S. Rust Belt towns that embraced President Donald Trump.

The city of approximately 50,000 people is home to some of the most deprived areas in England.

It was once a busy port, with vessels shuttling both goods and people to mainland Europe, but that stopped in 2013 when its ferry operator went bankrupt.

With a ""no-deal"" Brexit looming, Ramsgate has been in the news. At the end of December, the government awarded a $18 million contract to a shipping company to operate ferries from Ramsgate to Ostend, a city on the Belgian coast, in the event of a backlog at the nearby port of Dover.

However, it was later found that the company does not own any ships.

It's the kind of incident that feeds the public’s mistrust in government, according to Steve Coombes, the chairman of the Ramsgate Action Group, a nonpolitical residents’ organization.

Equally, for a town that has seen years of decline, it was hard for residents to see the benefits of remaining an E.U. member.

“The E.U. never bothered to explain to places like Ramsgate what use they are,"" said Coombes, a TV scriptwriter who voted to remain in the E.U. ""If they had done so, things might have been different.”

Britain contributed a net amount of around 350 billion pounds ($446 billion) to the E.U. annually, but the bloc has supported projects in Thanet with tens of millions of dollars in funding.

“Ramsgate feels far from Brussels and equally as far from London,” Coombes added.

After nearly two years of negotiations, Parliament is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May. It is opposed by politicians across the political spectrum — including by many in May's own party.

No one really knows what the future holds if May can't win enough support from fellow lawmakers.

Beverly Martin is a local politician who serves on the Thanet Council with Piper.

A member of May’s Conservative Party, she is unconvinced about the accuracy of the government’s own analysis showing that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would hurt the U.K. economy.

“I think that businesses are more resilient than we think,” she said.

The only thing these enthusiastic leave supporters hate more than the idea of staying in the E.U. is the withdrawal agreement that the prime minister negotiated.

Echoing the objections of many Brexit-supporting members of Parliament, Piper called May’s deal appalling.

“The cynic in me says they’ve constructed a bad deal to get the public to change their mind,” he said. “It’s either that or they are massively incompetent.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/brexit-true-believers-see-only-upside-quitting-e-u-n956186,
